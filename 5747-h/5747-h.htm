    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE POST OFFICE AT WAYNEBORO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could only keep the post office, mother, we should be all right,&rdquo;
       said Herbert Carr, as he and his mother sat together in the little sitting
      room of the plain cottage which the two had occupied ever since he was a
      boy of five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Herbert, but I am afraid there won't be much chance of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would want to take it from you, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are selfish, Herbert, and there is no office, however small, that is
      not sought after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the income last year?&rdquo; inquired Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carr referred to a blank book lying on the table in which the
      post-office accounts were kept, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred and ninety-eight dollars and fifty cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't think that would be much of an inducement to an able-bodied
      man, who could work at any business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was glad to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, but he had lost an arm in the war, and could not engage in
      any business that required both hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Herbert, but I am afraid there will be more than one who
      will be willing to relieve me of the duties. Old Mrs. Allen called at the
      office to-day, and told me she understood that there was a movement on
      foot to have Ebenezer Graham appointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Walsingham's nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is understood that the squire will throw his influence into the
      scale, and that will probably decide the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's very mean of Squire Walsingham,&rdquo; said Herbert, indignantly. &ldquo;He
      knows that you depend on the office for a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most men are selfish, my dear Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was an old schoolfellow of father's, and it was as his substitute
      that father went to the war where he was wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Herbert, but I am afraid that consideration won't weigh much with
      John Walsingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great mind to go and see him, mother. Have you any objections?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no objections, but I am afraid it will do no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Graham ought to be ashamed, with the profits of his store, to want
      the post office also. His store alone pays him handsomely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Graham is fond of money. He means to be a rich man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true enough. He is about the meanest man in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few words are needed in explanation, though the conversation explains
      itself pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's father, returning from the war with the loss of an arm, was
      fortunate enough to receive the appointment of postmaster, and thus earn a
      small, but, with strict economy, adequate income, until a fever terminated
      his earthly career at middle age. Mr. Graham was a rival applicant for the
      office, but Mr. Carr's services in the war were thought to give him
      superior claims, and he secured it. During the month that had elapsed
      since his death, Mrs. Carr had carried on the post office under a
      temporary appointment. She was a woman of good business capacity, and
      already familiar with the duties of the office, having assisted her
      husband, especially during his sickness, when nearly the whole work
      devolved upon her. Most of the village people were in favor of having her
      retained, but the local influence of Squire Walsingham and his nephew was
      so great that a petition in favor of the latter secured numerous
      signatures, and was already on file at the department in Washington, and
      backed by the congressman of the district, who was a political friend of
      the squire. Mrs. Carr was not aware that the movement for her displacement
      had gone so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already nine o'clock when Herbert's conversation with his mother
      ended, and he resolved to defer his call upon Squire Walsingham till the
      next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      About nine o'clock in the forenoon our young hero rang the bell of the
      village magnate, and with but little delay was ushered into his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Walsingham was a tall, portly man of fifty, sleek and evidently on
      excellent terms with himself. Indeed, he was but five years older than his
      nephew, Ebenezer Graham, and looked the younger of the two, despite the
      relationship. If he had been a United States Senator he could not have
      been more dignified in his deportment, or esteemed himself of greater
      consequence. He was a selfish man, but he was free from the mean traits
      that characterized his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the Carr boy,&rdquo; said the squire, pompously, looking over his
      spectacles at Herbert, as he entered the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Herbert Carr,&rdquo; said Herbert, shortly. &ldquo;You have known me all
      my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the squire, a little ruffled at the failure of his grand
      manner to impose upon his young visitor. &ldquo;Did I not call you the Carr
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not fancy being called the Carr boy, but he was there to ask a
      favor, and he thought it prudent not to show his dissatisfaction. He
      resolved to come to the point at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have called, Squire Walsingham,&rdquo; he commenced, &ldquo;to ask if you will use
      your influence to have my mother retained in charge of the post office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said the squire, somewhat embarrassed. &ldquo;I am not in charge of the
      post-office department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I am aware of that; but the postmaster general will be
      influenced by the recommendations of people in the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true!&rdquo; said the squire, complacently. &ldquo;Very true, and very proper. I
      do not pretend to say that my recommendation would not weigh with the
      authorities at Washington. Indeed, the member from our district is a
      personal friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how we are situated,&rdquo; continued Herbert, who thought it best to
      state his case as briefly as possible. &ldquo;Father was unable to save
      anything, and we have no money ahead. If mother can keep the post office,
      we shall get along nicely, but if she loses it, we shall have a hard
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised that in your father's long tenure of office he did not
      save something,&rdquo; said the squire, in a tone which indicated not only
      surprise but reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was not much chance to save on a salary of four hundred dollars a
      year,&rdquo; said Herbert, soberly, &ldquo;after supporting a family of three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said the squire, sagely; &ldquo;where there's a will there's a way.
      Improvidence is the great fault of the lower classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't belong to the lower classes,&rdquo; said Herbert, flushing with
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Walmsgham was secretly ambitious of representing his district some
      day in Congress, and he felt that he had made a mistake. It won't do for
      an aspirant to office to speak of the lower classes, and the squire
      hastened to repair his error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not the term I intended to imply,&rdquo; he condescended to explain.
      &ldquo;I meant to say that improvidence is the prevailing fault of those whose
      income is small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't had much chance to be improvident!&rdquo; said Herbert &ldquo;We have had
      to spend all our income, but we are not in debt&mdash;that is, we have no
      debts that we are unable to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said Squire Walsingham, &ldquo;but, my young constituent&mdash;I
      mean my young friend&mdash;I apprehend that you do not take a right view
      of public office. It is not designed to support a privileged class in
      luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luxury, on four hundred a year!&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking in general terms,&rdquo; said the squire, hastily. &ldquo;I mean to say
      that I cannot recommend a person to office simply because he or she needs
      the income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I know that; but my mother understands the duties of the office,
      and no complaint has been made that she does not make a good postmaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said the squire, non-commitally; &ldquo;but I am opposed upon
      principle to conferring offices upon women. Men are more efficient, and
      better qualified to discharge responsible duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said Herbert, his heart sinking, &ldquo;I am to understand that you
      do not favor the appointment of my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to hear that your mother was doing well,&rdquo; said the
      squire, &ldquo;but I cannot conscientiously favor the appointment of a woman to
      be postmaster of Wayneboro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means that he prefers the appointment should go to his nephew,&rdquo;
       thought Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my mother were not competent to discharge the duties,&rdquo; he said, his
      face showing his disappointment in spite of himself, &ldquo;I would not ask your
      influence, notwithstanding you were a schoolmate of father's, and he lost
      his arm while acting as your substitute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already said that I wish your mother well,&rdquo; said the squire,
      coloring, &ldquo;and in any other way I am ready to help her and you. Indeed, I
      may be able to secure you a situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Graham needs a boy in his store, and I think he will take you on my
      recommendation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Tom Tripp going away?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tripp boy is unsatisfactory, so Mr. Graham tells me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert knew something of what it would be to be employed by Mr. Graham.
      Tom Tripp worked early and late for a dollar and a half per week, without
      board, for a hard and suspicious taskmaster, who was continually finding
      fault with him. But for sheer necessity, he would have left Mr. Graham's
      store long ago. He had confided the unpleasantness of his position to
      Herbert more than once, and enlisted his sympathy and indignation. Herbert
      felt that he would not like to work for Mr. Graham at any price, more
      especially as it seemed likely that the storekeeper was likely to deprive
      his mother of her office and income.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not like to work for Mr. Graham, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me that you are very particular, young man,&rdquo; said Squire
      Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be willing to work for you, sir, but not for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said the squire, somewhat mollified, &ldquo;I will think of your case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert left the house, feeling that his mother's removal was only a
      matter of time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. HERBERT'S CHANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Herbert left the house of Squire Walsingham in a sober frame of mind. He
      saw clearly that his mother would not long remain in office, and without
      her official income they would find it hard to get along. To be sure, she
      received a pension of eight dollars a month, in consideration of her
      husband's services in the war, but eight dollars would not go far towards
      supporting their family, small as it was. There were other means of
      earning a living, to be sure, but Wayneboro was an agricultural town
      mainly, and unless he hired out on a farm there seemed no way open to him,
      while the little sewing his mother might be able to procure would probably
      pay her less than a dollar a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow fell sooner than he expected. In the course of the next week Mrs.
      Carr was notified that Ebenezer Graham had been appointed her successor,
      and she was directed to turn over the papers and property of the office to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received the official notification by the afternoon mail, and in the
      evening she was favored by a call from her successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer Graham was a small man, with insignificant, mean-looking
      features, including a pair of weazel-like eyes and a turn-up nose. It did
      not require a skillful physiognomist to read his character in his face.
      Meanness was stamped upon it in unmistakable characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said the widow, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, ma'am,&rdquo; said the storekeeper. &ldquo;I've called to see you, Mrs.
      Carr, about the post office, I presume you have heard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that you are to be my successor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. As long as your husband was alive, I didn't want to step into
      his shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are willing to step into mine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carr, smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so&mdash;that is, the gov'ment appear to think a man ought to be in
      charge of so responsible a position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad if you manage the office better than I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ma'am, it stands to reason that a man is better fitted for
      business than a woman,&rdquo; said Ebenezer Graham, in a smooth tone for he
      wanted to get over this rather awkward business as easily as possible.
      &ldquo;Women, you know, was made to adorn the domestic circles, et cetery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adorning the domestic circle won't give me a living,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carr,
      with some bitterness, for she knew that but for the grasping spirit of the
      man before her she would have been allowed to retain her office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was comin' to that,&rdquo; said the new postmaster. &ldquo;Of course, I appreciate
      your position as a widder, without much means, and I'm going to make you
      an offer; that is, your boy, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked up from a book he was reading, and listened with interest
      to hear the benevolent intentions of the new postmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to give him a place in my store,&rdquo; proceeded Ebenezer. &ldquo;I
      always keep a boy, and thinks I to myself, the wages I give will help
      along the widder Carr. You see, I like to combine business with
      consideration for my feller creeters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carr smiled faintly, for in spite of her serious strait she could not
      help being amused at the notion of Ebenezer Graham's philanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's going to become of Tom Tripp?&rdquo; asked Herbert, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Tripp isn't exactly the kind of boy I want in my store,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Graham. &ldquo;He's a harum-scarum sort of boy, and likes to shirk his work.
      Then I suspect he stops to play on the way when I send him on errands.
      Yesterday he was five minutes longer than he need to have been in goin' to
      Sam Dunning's to carry some groceries. Thomas doesn't seem to appreciate
      his privileges in bein' connected with a business like mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Tripp was hardly to blame for not recognizing his good luck in
      occupying a position where he received a dollar and a half a week for
      fourteen hours daily work, with half a dozen scoldings thrown in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I will suit you any better than Tom?&rdquo; asked Herbert, who
      did not think it necessary to thank Mr. Graham for the proffered
      engagement until he learned just what was expected of him, and what his
      pay was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a different sort of a boy,&rdquo; said Ebenezer, with an attempt at a
      pleasant smile. &ldquo;You've been brought up different. I've heard you're a
      smart, capable boy, that isn't afraid of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I am not, if I am fairly paid for my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new postmaster's jaw fell, and he looked uneasy, for he always grudged
      the money he paid out, even the paltry dollar and a half which went to
      poor Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always calkerlate to pay fair wages,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I ain't rich, and I
      can't afford to fling away money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you pay Tom Tripp?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, but he wanted to draw Mr. Graham out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pay Thomas a dollar and fifty cents a week,&rdquo; answered the storekeeper,
      in a tone which indicated that he regarded this, on the whole, as rather a
      munificent sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he works from seven in the morning till nine o'clock at night,&rdquo;
       proceeded Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them are the hours,&rdquo; said Ebenezer, who knew better how to make money
      than to speak grammatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes a pretty long day,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Carr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it does, ma'am, but it's no longer than I work myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get paid rather better, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, ma'am, as I am the proprietor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't think of working for any such sum,&rdquo; said Herbert, decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Graham looked disturbed, for he had reasons for desiring to secure
      Herbert, who was familiar with the routine of post-office work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might be able to offer you a leetle more, as you know
      how to tend the post office. That's worth somethin'! I'll give you&mdash;lemme
      see&mdash;twenty-five cents more; that is, a dollar and seventy-five cents
      a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and his mother exchanged glances. They hardly knew whether to feel
      more amused or disgusted at their visitor's meanness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;if you wish to secure my services, you will
      have to pay me three dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storekeeper held up both hands in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three dollars a week for a boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I will come for a short time for that sum, till you get used to
      the management of the post office, but I shall feel justified in leaving
      you when I can do better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must think I am made of money,&rdquo; said Ebenezer hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you can afford to pay me that salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For twenty minutes the new postmaster tried to beat down his prospective
      clerk, but Herbert was obstinate, and Ebenezer rather ruefully promised to
      give him his price, chiefly because it was absolutely necessary that he
      should engage some one who was more familiar with the post-office work
      than he was. Herbert agreed to go to work the next morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. A PRODIGAL SON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Herbert did not look forward with very joyful anticipations to the new
      engagement he had formed. He knew very well that he should not like
      Ebenezer Graham as an employer, but it was necessary that he should earn
      something, for the income was now but two dollars a week. He was sorry,
      too, to displace Tom Tripp, but upon this point his uneasiness was soon
      removed, for Tom dropped in just after Mr. Graham had left the house, and
      informed Herbert that he was to go to work the next day for a farmer in
      the neighborhood, at a dollar and a half per week, and board besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it, Tom,&rdquo; said Herbert, heartily. &ldquo;I didn't want to
      feel that I was depriving you of employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome to my place in the store,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I'm glad to give it
      up. Mr. Graham seemed to think I was made of iron, and I could work like a
      machine, without getting tired. I hope he pays you more than a dollar and
      a half a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has agreed to pay me three dollars,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom whistled in genuine amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! has the old man lost his senses?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He must be crazy
      to offer such wages as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't offer them. I told him I wouldn't come for less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how he came to pay such a price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he wanted me to take care of the post office. I know all about
      it, and he doesn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as he learns, he will reduce your wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you'll like store work better than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next two or three days were spent in removing the post office to one
      corner of Eben-ezer Graham's store. The removal was superintended by
      Herbert, who was not interfered with to any extent by his employer, nor
      required to do much work in the store. Our hero was agreeably surprised,
      and began to think he should get along better than he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the first week the storekeeper, while they were closing the
      shutters, said: &ldquo;I expect, Herbert, you'd just as lieves take your pay in
      groceries and goods from the store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Herbert, &ldquo;I prefer to be paid in money, and to pay for
      such goods as we buy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what odds it makes to you,&rdquo; said Ebenezer. &ldquo;It comes to the
      same thing, doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if it comes to the same thing,&rdquo; retorted Herbert, &ldquo;why do you want
      to pay me in goods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem! It saves trouble. I'll just charge everything you buy, and give you
      the balance Saturday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer the money, Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the storekeeper, considerably against his will, drew three dollars in
      bills from the drawer and handed them to his young clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good deal of money, Herbert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for a boy. There ain't
      many men would pay you such a good salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I earn every cent of it, Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said Herbert, whose views on the
      salary question differed essentially from those of his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Mr. Graham received a letter which evidently disturbed
      him. Before referring to its contents, it is necessary to explain that he
      had one son, nineteen years of age, who had gone to Boston two years
      previous, to take a place in a dry-goods store on Washington Street.
      Ebenezer Graham, Jr., or Eben, as he was generally called, was, in some
      respects, like his father. He had the same features, and was quite as
      mean, so far as others were concerned, but willing to spend money for his
      own selfish pleasures. He was fond of playing pool, and cards, and had
      contracted a dangerous fondness for whisky, which consumed all the money
      he could spare from necessary expenses, and even more, so that, as will
      presently appear, he failed to meet his board bills regularly. Eben had
      served an apprenticeship in his father's store, having been, in fact, Tom
      Tripp's predecessor; he tired of his father's strict discipline, and the
      small pay out of which he was required to purchase his clothes, and went
      to Boston to seek a wider sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do Eben justice, it must be admitted that he had good business
      capacity, and if he had been able, like his father, to exercise
      self-denial, and make money-getting his chief enjoyment, he would no doubt
      have become a rich man in time. As it was, whenever he could make his
      companions pay for his pleasures, he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now come to the letter which had brought disquietude to the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR: I understand that you are the father of Mr. Eben Graham, who
      has been a boarder at my house for the last six months. I regret to
      trouble you, but he is now owing me six weeks board, and I cannot get a
      cent out of him, though he knows I am a poor widow, dependent on my board
      money for my rent and house expenses. As he is a minor, the law makes you
      responsible for his bills, and, though I dislike to trouble you, I am
      obliged, in justice to myself, to ask you to settle his board bill, which
      I inclose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do me a great favor if you will send me the amount&mdash;thirty
      dollars&mdash;within a week, as my rent is coming due.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours respectfully, SUSAN JONES.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feelings of a man like Ebenezer Graham can be imagined when he read
      this unpleasant missive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty dollars!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;What can the graceless boy be thinking of,
      to fool away his money, and leave his bills to be settled by me. If this
      keeps on, I shall be ruined! It's too bad, when I am slaving here, for
      Eben to waste my substance on riotous living. I've a great mind to disown
      him. Let him go his own way, and fetch up in the poorhouse, if he
      chooses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it is not easy for a man to cast off an only son, even though he is as
      poorly supplied with natural affections as Ebenezer Graham. Besides,
      Eben's mother interceded for him, and the father, in bitterness of spirit,
      was about to mail a registered letter to Mrs. Jones, when the cause of his
      anguish suddenly made his appearance in the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, father?&rdquo; he said, nonchalantly, taking a cigar from his
      mouth. &ldquo;Didn't expect to see me, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brings you here, Eben?&rdquo; asked Mr. Graham, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the cars brought me to Stockton, and I've walked the rest of the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard of you,&rdquo; said his father, frowning. &ldquo;I got a letter last night
      from Mrs. Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said she was going to write,&rdquo; said Eben, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came it,&rdquo; said his father, his voice trembling with anger, &ldquo;that you
      haven't paid your board bill for six weeks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't have the money,&rdquo; said Eben, with a composure which was
      positively aggravating to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why didn't you have the money? Your wages are ample to pay all your
      expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It costs more money to live in Boston than you think for, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you get ten dollars a week, sir? At your age I got only seven, and
      saved two dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't live in Boston, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't smoke cigars,&rdquo; said his father, angrily, as he fixed his eye on
      the one his son was smoking. &ldquo;How much did you pay for that miserable
      weed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're mistaken, father. It's a very good article. I paid eight dollars a
      hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight dollars a hundred!&rdquo; gasped Mr. Graham. &ldquo;No wonder you can't pay
      your board bill&mdash;I can't afford to spend my money on cigars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you can, father, if you choose. Why, you're a rich man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rich man!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Graham, nervously. &ldquo;It would take a rich man to
      pay your bills. But you haven't told me why you have come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost my situation, father&mdash;some meddlesome fellow told my employer
      that I occasionally played a game of pool, and my tailor came to the store
      and dunned me; so old Boggs gave me a long lecture and my walking papers,
      and here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer Graham was sorely troubled, and, though he isn't a favorite of
      mine, I confess, that in this matter he has my sincere sympathy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. HERBERT LOSES HIS PLACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ebenezer Graham with some difficulty ascertained from Eben that he had
      other bills, amounting in the aggregate to forty-seven dollars. This added
      to the board bill, made a total of seventy-seven dollars. Mr. Graham's
      face elongated perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is bad enough,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you have lost your income also, and
      that makes matters worse. Isn't there a chance of the firm taking you
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the prodigal. &ldquo;You see, we had a flare up, and I
      expressed my opinion of them pretty plainly. They wouldn't take me back if
      I'd come for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they won't give you a recommendation, either?&rdquo; said Ebenezer, with a
      half groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I should say not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have ruined your prospects so far as Boston is concerned,&rdquo; said
      his father, bitterly. &ldquo;May I ask how you expect to get along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; said Eben, with cheerful confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to go to California. If I can't get any situation in San
      Francisco, I can go to the mines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine, upon my word!&rdquo; said his father, sarcastically. &ldquo;And how do you
      propose to get to California?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can go either by steamer, across the isthmus, or over the Union Pacific
      road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't what I mean. Where are you to get the money to pay your fare
      with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will supply that,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do? Well, it strikes me you have some assurance,&rdquo; ejaculated Mr.
      Graham. &ldquo;You expect me to advance hundreds of dollars, made by working
      early and late, to support a spendthrift son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll pay you back as soon as I am able,&rdquo; said Eben, a little abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt! You'd pay me in the same way you pay your board bills,&rdquo; said
      Ebenezer, who may be excused for the sneer. &ldquo;I can invest my money to
      better advantage than upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you will not do that,&rdquo; said Eben, sullenly, &ldquo;I will leave you to
      suggest a plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one plan I can think of, Eben. Go back to your old place in
      the store. I will dismiss the Carr boy, and you can attend to the post
      office, and do the store work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, go back to tending a country grocery, after being a salesman in a
      city store!&rdquo; exclaimed Eben, disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it seems the only thing you have left. It's your own fault that you
      are not still a salesman in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben took the cigar from his mouth, and thought rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;if I agree to do this, what will you pay
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will I pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, will you pay me ten dollars a week&mdash;the same as I got at
      Hanbury &amp; Deane's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten dollars a week!&rdquo; ejaculated Ebenezer, &ldquo;I don't get any more than that
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there's a little mistake in your calculations, father,&rdquo; said
      Eben, significantly. &ldquo;If you don't make at least forty dollars a week,
      including the post office, then I am mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are&mdash;ridiculously mistaken!&rdquo; said his father, sharply. &ldquo;What
      you presume is entirely out of the question. You forget that you will be
      getting your board, and Tom Tripp only received a dollar and a half a week
      without board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you pay to Herbert Carr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pay him a leetle more,&rdquo; admitted Ebenezer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you give me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you your board and clothes,&rdquo; said Ebenezer, &ldquo;and that seems to
      be more than you made in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in earnest?&rdquo; asked Eben, in genuine dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. It isn't a bad offer, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose a young man like me can get along without money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to get along without money for the next two years, after the
      sums you've wasted in Boston. It will cripple me to pay your bills,&rdquo; and
      the storekeeper groaned at the thought of the inroads the payment would
      make on his bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're poorer than I thought, if seventy-five dollars will cripple you,&rdquo;
       said Eben, who knew his father's circumstances too well to be moved by
      this representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be in the poorhouse before many years if I undertake to pay all
      your bills, Eben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all, this was not, perhaps, an exaggeration, for a spendthrift son
      can get through a great deal of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't get along without money, father,&rdquo; said Eben, decidedly. &ldquo;How can
      I buy cigars, let alone other things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want you to smoke cigars. You'll be a great deal better off
      without them,&rdquo; said his father, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand; it's necessary to my health,&rdquo; said Eben, rather absurdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't smoke at my expense,&rdquo; said Ebenezer, decidedly. &ldquo;I don't smoke
      myself, and I never knew any good come of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, I must have some money. What will people say about a young
      man of my age not having a cent in his pocket? They think my father is
      very mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll allow you fifty cents a week,&rdquo; said Mr. Graham, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't do! You seem to think I am only six or seven years old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally, after considerable haggling, Mr. Graham agreed to pay his son a
      dollar and a half a week, in cash, besides board and clothes. He reflected
      that he should be obliged to board and clothe his son at any rate, and
      should save a dollar and a half from Herbert's wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when will you be ready to go to work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have a few days to loaf, father. I have been hard at work for a
      long time, and need some rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can begin next Monday morning. I'll get Herbert to show you how
      to prepare the mail, so that you won't have any trouble about the
      post-office work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, father, how do you happen to have the post office? I thought
      Mrs. Carr was to carry it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she did, for a time, but a woman ain't fit for a public position of
      that kind. So I applied for the position, and got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's Mrs. Carr going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got her pension,&rdquo; said Ebenezer, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight dollars a month, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't much to support a family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll have to do something else, then, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't much to do in Wayneboro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't my lookout. She can take in sewing, or washing,&rdquo; suggested
      Ebenezer, who did not trouble himself much about the care of his
      neighbors. &ldquo;Besides there's Herbert&mdash;he can earn something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm to take his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, I ain't under any obligations to provide them a livin'. I've got
      enough to take care of myself and my family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better have let her keep the post office,&rdquo; said Eben. He was not
      less selfish than his father, but then his own interests were not
      concerned. He would not have scrupled, in his father's case, to do
      precisely the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's lucky I've got a little extra income,&rdquo; said Ebenezer, bitterly; &ldquo;now
      I've got your bills to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall have to accept your offer, father,&rdquo; said Eben, &ldquo;for the
      present; but I hope you'll think better of my California plan after a
      while. Why, there's a fellow I know went out there last year, went up to
      the mines, and now he's worth five thousand dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must be a very different sort of a person from you,&rdquo; retorted his
      father, sagaciously. &ldquo;You would never succeed there, if you can't in
      Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never had a chance to try,&rdquo; grumbled Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was sound sense in what his father said. Failure at home is very
      likely to be followed by failure away from home. There have been cases
      that seemed to disprove my assertion, but in such cases failure has only
      been changed into success by earnest work. I say to my young readers,
      therefore, never give up a certainty at home to tempt the chances of
      success in a distant State, unless you are prepared for disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the engagement had been made with Eben, Mr. Graham called Herbert to
      his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I won't need you after Saturday night. My son is
      going into the store, and will do all I require. You can tell him how to
      prepare the mails, et cetery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; answered Herbert. It was not wholly a surprise, but it
      was a disappointment, for he did not know how he could make three dollars
      a week in any other way, unless he left Wayneboro.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. EBEN'S SCHEME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saturday night came, and with it the end of Herbert's engagement in the
      post office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pocketed the three dollars which his employer grudgingly gave him, and
      set out on his way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, Herbert,&rdquo; said Eben. &ldquo;I'll walk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert didn't care much for Eben's company but he was too polite to say
      so. He waited therefore, till Eben appeared with hat and cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to cut you out of your place, Herbert,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't my fault, for I don't want to go into the store,&rdquo; proceeded
      Eben. &ldquo;A fellow that's stood behind the counter in a city store is fit for
      something better, but it's the old man's fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert made no comment, and Eben proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it's the old man's fault. He's awfully stingy, you know
      that yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did know it, but thought it would not be in good taste to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Wayneboro is rather dull for you after living in the city,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so. This village is a dull hole, and yet father expects me
      to stay here cooped up in a little country store. I won't stay here long,
      you may be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know yet. I want to go to California, but I can't unless the old
      man comes down with the requisite amount of tin. You'll soon have your
      situation back again. I won't stand in your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not very particular about going back,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;but I must find
      something to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; said Eben. &ldquo;The place will do well enough for a boy like you,
      but I am a young man, and entitled to look higher. By the way, I've got
      something in view that may bring me in five thousand dollars within a
      month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert stared at his companion in surprise, not knowing any short cut to
      wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; he asked, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don't care to tell what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mind&mdash;it's a lottery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Herbert, in a tone of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Eben. &ldquo;You may think lotteries are a fraud and all that,
      but I know a man in Boston who drew last month a prize of fifteen thousand
      dollars. The ticket only cost him a dollar. What do you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such cases can't be very common,&rdquo; said Herbert, who had a good share of
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so uncommon as you think,&rdquo; returned Eben, nodding. &ldquo;I don't mean to
      say that many draw prizes as large as that, but there are other prizes of
      five thousand dollars, and one thousand, and so on. It would be very
      comfortable to draw a prize of even five hundred, wouldn't it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert admitted that it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd send for a ticket by Monday morning's mail,&rdquo; continued Eben, &ldquo;if I
      wasn't so hard up. The old man's mad because I ran into debt, and he won't
      give me a cent. Will you do me a favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Herbert, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me two dollars. You've got it, I know, because you were paid off
      to-night. I would send for two tickets, and agree to give you quarter of
      what I draw. Isn't that fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;but I haven't any money to lend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have three dollars in your pocket at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it isn't mine. I must hand it to mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give up the chance of winning a prize. I'll promise to give you half
      of whatever I draw, besides paying back the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I can't spare the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are getting as miserly as the old man,&rdquo; said Eben, with a forced
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben,&rdquo; said Herbert, seriously, &ldquo;you don't seem to understand our
      position. Mother has lost the post office, and has but eight dollars a
      month income. I've earned three dollars this week, but next week I may
      earn nothing. You see, I can't afford to spend money for lottery tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose by your caution you lose five hundred dollars. Nothing risk,
      nothing gain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no money to risk,&rdquo; said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, do as you please!&rdquo; said Eben, evidently disappointed. &ldquo;I
      thought I'd make you the offer, because I should like to see you win a big
      prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your friendly intention,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;but I am afraid
      there are a good many more blanks than prizes. If there were not, it
      wouldn't pay the lottery men to carry on the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was common sense, and I cannot forbear at this point to press it upon
      the attention of my young reader. Of all schemes of gaining wealth, about
      the most foolish is spending money for lottery tickets. It has been
      estimated by a sagacious writer that there is about as much likelihood of
      drawing a large prize in a lottery as of being struck by lightning and
      that, let us hope, is very small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I won't go any farther,&rdquo; said Eben, abruptly, having become
      convinced that Herbert could not be prevailed upon to lend him money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, then,&rdquo; said Herbert &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, I'm out of work,&rdquo; said Herbert, as he entered the little
      sitting room, and threw down his week's wages. Our young hero was of a
      cheerful temperament but he looked and felt sober when he said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for the Grahams we should have a comfortable living,&rdquo; the boy
      proceeded. &ldquo;First, the father took away the post office from you, and now
      the son has robbed me of my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be discouraged, Herbert,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;God will find us a way
      out of our troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had been trained to have a reverence for religion, and had faith
      in the providential care of his heavenly Father, and his mother's words
      recalled his cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, mother,&rdquo; he said, more hopefully. &ldquo;I was feeling
      low-spirited to-night, but I won't feel so any more. I don't see how we
      are to live, but I won't let it trouble me tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us do our part, and leave the rest to God,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carr. &ldquo;He won't
      support us in idleness, but I am sure that in some way relief will come if
      we are ready to help ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God helps them that help themselves,&rdquo; repeated Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. To-morrow is Sunday, and we won't let any worldly anxieties
      spoil that day for us. When Monday comes, we will think over what is best
      to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Herbert and his mother attended church in neat apparel, and
      those who saw their cheerful faces were not likely to guess the serious
      condition of their affairs. They were not in debt, to be sure, but, unless
      employment came soon, they were likely to be ere long, for they had barely
      enough money ahead to last them two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday morning came, and brought its burden of care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish there was a factory in Wayneboro,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I am told that
      boys of my age sometimes earn six or seven dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard so. Here there seems nothing, except working on a farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the farmers expect boys to take their pay principally in board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a consideration, but, if possible, I hope we shall not be
      separated at meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try other things first,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;How would you like some
      fish for dinner, mother? My time isn't of any particular value, and I
      might as well go fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, Herbert. It will save our buying meat, which, indeed, we can
      hardly afford to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert felt that anything was better than idleness, so he took his pole
      from the shed, and, after digging a supply of bait, set out for the banks
      of the river half a mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a grassy lane leading from the main street, he walked down to the
      river with the pole on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not destined to solitude, for under a tree whose branches hung over
      the river sat a young man, perhaps twenty-five years of age, with a book
      in his hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. HERBERT'S GOOD LUCK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said the young man, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; answered Herbert, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recognized the young man, though he had never seen him before, as a
      visitor from the city, who was boarding at the hotel, if the village
      tavern could be so designated. He seemed to be a studious young man, for
      he always had a book in his hand. He had a pleasant face, but was pale and
      slender, and was evidently in poor health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are going to try your luck at fishing,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I have nothing else to do, and that brings me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have nothing else to do; but I judge from your appearance that
      you have not the same reason for being idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I have never been troubled in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fortunate. Health is a blessing not to be overestimated. It is
      better than money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is, sir; but at present I think I should value a little
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in want of it?&rdquo; asked the young man, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I have just lost my place in the post office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have seen you in the post office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; my mother had charge of the office till two weeks since, when
      it was transferred to Mr. Graham. He employed me to attend to the duties,
      and serve the customers in the store, till Saturday night, when I was
      succeeded by his son, who had just returned from the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother is a widow, is she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where you live; I have had it pointed out to me. Your father
      served in the war, did he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and the injuries he received hastened his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked thoughtful. Then he said: &ldquo;How much did Mr. Graham
      pay you for your services?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not&mdash;excuse the question&mdash;all you and your mother had
      to depend upon, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite; mother receives a pension of eight dollars per month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five dollars a week altogether&mdash;that is very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only two dollars now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but you have health and strength, and those will bring money. In
      one respect you are more fortunate than I. You have a mother&mdash;I have
      neither father nor mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry for you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; anyone is to be pitied who has lost his parents. Now, as I
      have asked about your affairs, it is only fair that I should tell you
      about myself. To begin with, I am rich. Don't look envious, for there is
      something to counterbalance. I am of feeble constitution, and the doctors
      say that my lungs are affected. I have studied law, but the state of my
      health has obliged me to give up, for the present at least, the practice
      of my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you are rich you do not need to practice,&rdquo; said Herbert, who may
      be excused for still thinking his companion's lot a happy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not need to practice my profession, so far as the earning of
      money is concerned; but I want something to occupy my mind. The doctors
      say I ought to take considerable out-door exercise; but I suppose my
      physical condition makes me indolent, for my chief exercise has been, thus
      far, to wander to the banks of the river and read under the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't very severe exercise,&rdquo; said Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; still it keeps me out in the open air, and that is something. Now
      tell me, what are your plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hope is to find something to do that will enable me to help mother;
      but there doesn't seem much chance of finding anything in Wayneboro. Do
      you think I could get a place in the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might; but even if you did, you would find it difficult to earn your
      own living, and there would be no chance of your helping your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, though naturally sanguine and hopeful, looked sober. Just then he
      had a bite, and drew out a good-sized pickerel. This gave a new direction
      to his thoughts, and he exclaimed, triumphantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at this pickerel! He must weigh over two pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of that,&rdquo; said the young man, rising and examining the fish with
      interest. &ldquo;Let me use your pole, and see what luck I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man, some ten minutes later, succeeded in catching a smaller
      pickerel, perhaps half the size of Herbert's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do for me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though it doesn't come up to your catch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two hours Herbert and his friend alternately used the pole, and the
      result was quite a handsome lot of fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have more fish than you want,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;You had better
      bring what you don't want to the hotel. I heard the landlord say he would
      like to buy some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would suit me,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;If he wants fish, I want money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along with me, then. Really, I don't know when I have passed a
      forenoon so pleasantly. Usually I get tired of my own company, and the day
      seems long to me. I believe I see my way clear to a better way of spending
      my time. You say you want a place. How would you like me for an employer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I should like you, but you are not in any business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young man, smiling; &ldquo;or, rather, my business is the pursuit
      of health and pleasure just now. In that I think you can help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad to, if I can, Mr.&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is George Melville. Let me explain my idea to you. I want your
      company to relieve my solitude. In your company I shall have enterprise
      enough to go hunting and fishing, and follow out in good faith my doctor's
      directions. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like that better than being in the post office,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      would seem like being paid for having a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much would you consider your services worth?&rdquo; asked Mr. Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am content to leave that to you,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we say six dollars a week, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six dollars a week!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that enough?&rdquo; asked Melville, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than I can earn. Mr. Graham thought he was over-paying me with
      three dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find me a different man from Mr. Graham, Herbert. I am aware
      that six dollars is larger pay than is generally given to boys of your
      age. But I can afford to pay it, and I have no doubt you will find the
      money useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will quite set us on our feet again, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert,
      earnestly. &ldquo;You are very generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don't know what a hard taskmaster you may find me,&rdquo; said the
      young man, playfully. &ldquo;By the way, I consider that you have already
      entered upon your duties. To-day is the first day. Now come to the hotel
      with me, and see what you can get for the fish. I happen to know that two
      of the guests, a lady and her daughter, are anxious for a good fish dinner
      and, as there is no market here, I think the landlord will be glad to buy
      from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melville was right. Mr. Barton, the landlord, purchased the fish that
      Herbert had to sell, for sixty cents, which he promptly paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't that pay you for your morning's work?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know but the money ought to go to you, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said
      Herbert, &ldquo;as I am now in your employ. Besides, you caught a part of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waive all claim to compensation,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;though it would
      be a novel sensation to receive money for services rendered. What will you
      say, Herbert, when I tell you that I never earned a dollar in my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really true,&rdquo; said George Melville, &ldquo;my life has been passed at
      school and college, and I have never had occasion to work for money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in luck, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that; I think those who work for the money they receive are
      happy. Tell me, now, don't you feel more satisfaction in the sixty cents
      you have just been paid because you have earned it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. The happiest men are those who are usefully employed. Don't
      forget that, and never sigh for the opportunity to lead an idle life. But
      I suppose your dinner is ready. You may go home, and come back at three
      o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert made good time going home. He was eager to tell his mother the
      good news of his engagement.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. EBEN GROWS ENVIOUS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; said Herbert, as he entered the house, &ldquo;I have brought you
      enough fish for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited to see what luck you would have, Herbert, and therefore have not
      got dinner ready. You will have to wait a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be all the hungrier, mother,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carr could not help noticing the beaming look on her som's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you had received a legacy, Herbert,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; he said, displaying the sixty cents he had received from
      the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are ten cents more than I should have received for a whole day's
      work at the store,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get it, Herbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sold a mess of fish to Mr. Barton, of the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have had good luck in fishing,&rdquo; said his mother, looking
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had help, mother. Mr. Melville, the young man from the city, who boards
      at the hotel, helped me fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Herbert, you have made a good beginning. I couldn't help feeling a
      little depressed when you left me this morning, reflecting that we had but
      my pension to depend upon. It seemed so unlucky that Eben Graham should
      have come home just at this time to deprive you of your place in the
      store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a piece of good luck for me, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carr, naturally puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have a better situation already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Herbert, who had been saving the best news for the last, told his
      mother of his engagement as Mr. Melville's companion, and the handsome
      compensation he was to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six dollars a week!&rdquo; repeated his mother. &ldquo;That is indeed generous.
      Herbert, we did well to trust in Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother; and we have not trusted in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Herbert did some chores for his mother, and then went to the
      hotel to meet his new employer. He found him occupying a large and
      pleasant room on the second floor. The table near the window was covered
      with books, and there were some thirty or forty volumes arranged on
      shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always bring books with me, Herbert,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I am very
      fond of reading, and hitherto I have occupied too much time, perhaps, in
      that way&mdash;too much, because it has interfered with necessary
      exercise. Hereafter I shall devote my forenoon to some kind of outdoor
      exercise in your company, and in the afternoon you can read to me, or we
      can converse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I read to you now, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; here is a recent magazine. I will select an article for you to read.
      It will rest my eyes, and besides it is pleasanter to have a companion
      than to read one's self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The article was one that interested Herbert as well as Mr. Melville, and
      he was surprised when he had finished to find that it was nearly five
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't the reading tire you, Herbert?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident that your lungs are stronger than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock Melville dismissed his young companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to come this evening?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I wouldn't think of taking up your evenings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the post office I had to stay till eight o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably it was necessary there; I won't task you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I come to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At nine o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't very early,&rdquo; said Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't get up very early. My health won't allow me to cultivate
      early rising. I shall not be through breakfast much before nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you don't mean to overwork me, Mr. Melville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for it would involve overworking myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly have an easy time,&rdquo; thought Herbert, as he walked
      homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected with satisfaction that he was being paid at the rate of a
      dollar a day, which was quite beyond anything he had ever before earned.
      Indeed, to-day he had earned sixty cents besides. The sum received for the
      fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Herbert went to the store to purchase some articles for his
      mother. He was waited on by Mr. Graham in person. As the articles called
      for would amount to nearly one dollar, the storekeeper said, cautiously:
      &ldquo;Of course, you are prepared to pay cash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; returned Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned it because I knew your income was small,&rdquo; said Ebenezer,
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than it was last week,&rdquo; said Herbert, rather enjoying the
      prospect of surprising the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you ain't found anything to do, have you?&rdquo; asked Mr. Graham, his
      face indicating curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I am engaged as companion by Mr. Melville, who is staying at
      the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what he wants of a companion,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, with
      that disposition to criticise the affairs of his neighbors often found in
      country places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks he needs one,&rdquo; answered Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much does he pay you now?&rdquo; queried Ebenezer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it!&rdquo; ejaculated the storekeeper. &ldquo;Why, the man must be
      crazy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think he is,&rdquo; said Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got plenty of money, I take it?&rdquo; continued Ebenezer, who had a good share
      of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he tells me he is rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money has he got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare! You're lucky, that's a fact!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an interested listener to this conversation in the person of
      Eben, who had been in the store all day, taking Herbert's place. As we
      know, the position by no means suited the young man. He had been employed
      in a store in Boston, and to come back to a small country grocery might
      certainly be considered a descent. Besides, the small compensation allowed
      him was far from satisfying Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was even more dissatisfied when he learned how fortunate Herbert was.
      To be selected as a companion by a rich young man was just what he would
      have liked himself, and he flattered himself that he should make a more
      desirable companion than a mere boy like Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      As our hero was leaving the store, Eben called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that you were telling father about going round with a young man
      from the city?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert repeated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he pays you six dollars a week?&rdquo; asked Eben, enviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; of course, I shouldn't have asked so much, but he fixed the price
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he is very rich?&rdquo; said Eben, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a splendid chance it would be for me!&rdquo; thought Eben. &ldquo;If I could get
      intimate with a man like that, he might set me up in business some day;
      perhaps take me to Europe, or round the world!&rdquo; &ldquo;How much of the time do
      you expect to be with this Mr. Melville?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert answered the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he seem like a man easy to get along with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben inwardly decided that, if he could, he would oust Herbert from his
      desirable place, and substitute himself. It was a very mean thought, but
      Eben inherited meanness from his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you do me a favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take my place in the store this evening? I am not feeling well,
      and want to take a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Herbert, &ldquo;as soon as I have run home to tell mother where
      I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good fellow. You shan't lose anything by it. I'll give you ten
      cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't pay me anything, Eben. I'll do it as a favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a trump, Herbert. Come back as soon as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Eben was released from the store, he went over to the hotel, and
      inquired for Mr. Melville, leaving his unsuspecting young substitute in
      the post office.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. EBEN'S ASSURANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man wishes to see you, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Melville looked up in some surprise from his book, and said: &ldquo;You
      may show him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be Herbert,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the door was opened, and the visitor shown in, Mr. Melville found
      it was an older person than Herbert. Eben, for it was he, distorted his
      mean features into what he regarded as a pleasant smile, and, without
      waiting to receive a welcome, came forward with extended hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are Mr. Melville,&rdquo; he said, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is my name,&rdquo; said Melville, looking puzzled; &ldquo;I don't remember
      you. Have I met you before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me in father's store, very likely,&rdquo; said Eben. &ldquo;I am Eben Graham,
      son of Ebenezer Graham, the postmaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! That accounts for your face looking familiar. You resemble your
      father very closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a chip off the old block with modern improvements,&rdquo; said Eben,
      smirking. &ldquo;Father's always lived in the country, and he ain't very
      stylish. I've been employed in Boston for a couple of years past, and got
      a little city polish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't show much of it,&rdquo; thought Melville, but he refrained from
      saying so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have come home to assist your father,&rdquo; he said, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not exactly,&rdquo; answered Eben, &ldquo;I feel that a country store isn't
      my sphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you propose to go back to the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably I shall do so eventually, but I may stay here in Wayneboro a
      while if I can make satisfactory arrangements. I assure you that it was
      not my wish to take Herbert Carr's place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert told me that you had assumed his duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only ad interim. I assure you, it is only ad interim. I am quite
      ready to give back the place to Herbert, who is better suited to it than
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what the fellow is driving at,&rdquo; thought Melville. Eben did not
      long leave him in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert tells me that he has made an engagement with you,&rdquo; continued
      Eben, desiring to come to his business as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we have made a mutual arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it is very nice for him; and so I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am quite as much a gainer by it as he is,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert was right. He is easily suited,&rdquo; said Eben, to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Eben added, clearing his throat, &ldquo;Herbert isn't so much of a
      companion to you as if he were a few years older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that; it seems to me that he is a very pleasant companion,
      young as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, Herbert is a nice boy, and father was glad to help him along
      by giving him a place, with a larger salary than he ever paid before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he driving at?&rdquo; thought Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To come to the point, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Eben, &ldquo;I have made bold to call
      upon you to suggest a little difference in your arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Melville, coldly. Though he had no idea what his singular
      visitor was about to propose, it struck him emphatically that Eben was
      interfering in an unwarrantable manner with his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Eben, &ldquo;I'm a good deal nearer your age than Herbert,
      and I've had the advantage of residing in the city, which Herbert hasn't,
      and naturally should be more company to you. Then, again, Herbert could do
      the work in the post office and store, which I am doing, nearly as well as
      I can. I'll undertake to get father to give him back his place, and then I
      shall be happy to make an arrangement with you to go hunting and fishing,
      or anything else that you choose. I am sure I should enjoy your company,
      Mr. Melville,&rdquo; concluded Eben, rubbing his hands complacently and
      surveying George Melville with an insinuating smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have certainly taken considerable trouble to arrange this matter for
      me,&rdquo; said Melville, with a sarcasm which Eben did not detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no trouble at all!&rdquo; said Eben, cheerfully. &ldquo;You see, the idea came
      into my head when Herbert told me of his arrangements with you, and I
      thought I'd come and see you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you mention it to Herbert?&rdquo; asked George Melville, with some
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, I didn't. I didn't know how Herbert would look at it. I got
      Herbert to take my place in the store while I ran over to see you about
      the matter. By the way, though I am some years older than Herbert, I
      shan't ask more than you pay him. In fact, I am willing to leave the pay
      to your liberality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very considerate!&rdquo; said Melville, hardly knowing whether to be
      amused or provoked by the cool assurance of his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all!&rdquo; returned Eben, complacently. &ldquo;I guess I've fetched him!&rdquo;
       he reflected, looking at Mr. Melville through his small, half-closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have certainly surprised me very much, Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said Melville,
      &ldquo;by the nature of your suggestion. I won't take into consideration the
      question whether you have thought more of your own pleasure or mine. So
      far as the latter is concerned, you have made a mistake in supposing that
      Herbert's youth is any drawback to his qualification as a companion.
      Indeed, his youth and cheerful temperament make him more attractive in my
      eyes. I hope, Mr. Graham, you will excuse me for saying that he suits me
      better than you possibly could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben's countenance fell, and he looked quite discomfited and mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't suppose a raw, country boy would be likely to suit a gentleman
      of taste, who has resided in the city,&rdquo; he said, with asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will have a chance to correct your impression,&rdquo; said Melville,
      with a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't care to accept my offer?&rdquo; said Eben, regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no. If you will excuse me for suggesting it, Mr. Graham, it
      would have been more considerate for you to have apprised Herbert of your
      object in asking him to take your place this evening. Probably he had no
      idea that you meant to supersede him with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben tossed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't think, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I was after the extra
      pay. Six dollars doesn't seem much to me. I was earning ten dollars a week
      in Boston, and if I had stayed, should probably have been raised to
      twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you were really consenting to a sacrifice in offering to enter my
      employment at six dollars a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am all the more convinced that I have decided for the best in
      retaining Herbert. I do not wish to interfere with your prospects in the
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as for that,&rdquo; said Eben, judging that he had gone too far, &ldquo;I don't
      care to go back to the city just yet. I've been confined pretty steadily,
      and a few weeks in the country, hunting and fishing, will do me good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Melville bowed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben felt that he had no excuse for staying longer, and reluctantly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should think better of what I've proposed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can let
      me know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's rather a queer young man,&rdquo; muttered Eben, as he descended the
      stairs. &ldquo;It's funny that he should prefer a country boy like Herbert to a
      young man like me who's seen life, and got some city polish&mdash;at the
      same price, too! He don't seem to see his own interest. I'm sorry, for it
      would have been a good deal more interesting to me, going round with him a
      few hours a day, than tending store for father. There's one thing sure, I
      won't do it long. I'm fitted for a higher position than that, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For downright impudence and cool assurance, I think that young man will
      bear off the palm,&rdquo; thought George Melville, as his unwelcome visitor left
      the room. &ldquo;Herbert is in no danger from him. It would probably surprise
      him if he knew that I should consider his company as an intolerable bore.
      I will tell Herbert to-morrow the good turn his friend has tried to do
      him.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE SOLITARY FARMHOUSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Eben had been sensitive, the cool reception which he met with at the
      hands of Mr. Melville would have disturbed him. As it was, he felt angry
      and disappointed, and desirous of &ldquo;coming up with&rdquo; Herbert, as he
      expressed it, though it was hard to see in what way the boy had injured
      him. It did not seem quite clear at present how he was to punish Herbert,
      but he only waited for an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Herbert learned, the next morning, from Mr. Melville, in what manner
      Eben had tried to undermine him, and deprive him of his situation, he was
      naturally indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think Eben Graham could be so mean,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was certainly a mean thing to do, Herbert,&rdquo; said George Melville; &ldquo;but
      you can afford to treat young Graham with contempt, as he has been unable
      to do you any injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do this morning, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like a row on the river,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;Do you know of any
      boat we can have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter Ingalls has a boat; I think we can hire that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may go and ascertain whether we can have it, or I will go with
      you to avoid loss of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat was readily loaned, and the two were soon on the river. Mr.
      Melville first took the oars, but he was quickly fatigued, and resigned
      them to Herbert, who was strong and muscular for his age. As his companion
      observed his strong and steady strokes, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert, I am disposed to envy you your strength and endurance. I get
      tired very easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not strong when a boy?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had much endurance. My mother had a feeble constitution and was
      consumptive, and I inherit something of her weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate that you have money, Mr. Melville, so that you are not
      obliged to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but I would give half my fortune to be strong and well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert noticed the hectic flush upon Mr. Melville's cheeks, and his
      white, transparent hands, and his sympathy was aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;that I am more fortunate than I thought
      in my health and strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are blessings not to be overestimated, Herbert. However, my lot is,
      on the whole, a happy one, even though my life will probably be brief, and
      I have still many sources of satisfaction and enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The river led away from the village, flowing between wooded banks, with
      here and there a cottage set in the midst of the fields. Lying back in the
      stern, Melville enjoyed their tranquil passage, when their attention was
      suddenly attracted by a boy who stood on the bank, frantically waving his
      hat. Melville was the first to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can that boy want?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert immediately looked around, and exclaimed in surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Tom Tripp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Row to shore, and see what he wants,&rdquo; said Melville, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were already near, and in a brief space of time they touched the
      bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a tramp in the house, stealing all he can lay hands on,&rdquo; answered
      Tom, in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farmer Cole's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cole was the farmer for whom Tom Tripp was working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom explained that the farmer was gone to the village, leaving his wife
      alone. A tramp had come to the door and asked for a meal. While Mrs. Cole
      was getting something for him, the visitor looked about him and, finding
      that there was no man about, boldly demanded money, after unceremoniously
      possessing himself of the silver spoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he armed?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I don't think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know that you have gone for help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he did not see me. I came from the fields, and saw him through the
      window. Mrs. Cole thinks I am in the field and there is no help near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Physical courage and physical strength do not always go together, and a
      weak man often excels a strong man in bravery. George Melville was
      thoroughly roused. For injustice or brutality he had a hearty contempt,
      and he was not one to stand by and see a ruffian triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Herbert,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let us go to the help of this poor woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; answered Herbert, his eyes flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before describing the appearance of Herbert and George Melville upon the
      scene, I will go back a few minutes and relate what happened at the
      farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cole was engaged in ironing when she heard a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering the summons, she found herself confronted by an ill-looking
      fellow whose dusty and travel-soiled garments revealed the character of
      the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you wish?&rdquo; asked the farmer's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm hungry!&rdquo; said the tramp. &ldquo;Can you give me something to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Cole, cheerfully, for the good woman could not find
      it in her heart to turn away a fellow creature suffering from hunger. &ldquo;We
      have enough and to spare. Come in, and sit down at the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor followed her into the kitchen and took a seat at the table,
      while the farmer's wife went to the pantry and brought out half a loaf of
      bread and a plate of cold meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp was not long in attacking it, but after a few mouthfuls laid
      down his knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the coffee?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no warm coffee,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you drink coffee in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but breakfast was over two or three hours since. Shall I get you a
      glass of water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you any cider?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me you are particular,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cole, growing indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same I want some cider,&rdquo; said the tramp, impudently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no cider,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Cole, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty farmhouse this is, without cider,&rdquo; growled the tramp. &ldquo;You can
      make me some coffee, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you to order me round in my own house?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Cole,
      angrily. &ldquo;One would think you took this for a hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it for what I please,&rdquo; said the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my husband were here you wouldn't dare to talk to me like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an unguarded admission, made on the impulse of the moment, and Mrs.
      Cole felt its imprudence as soon as she had uttered the words, but it was
      too late to recall them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your husband?&rdquo; asked the tramp, his face lighting up with a
      gleam of exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near by,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Cole, evasively; but her visitor saw that this
      was not correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money have you in the house?&rdquo; he demanded, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money?&rdquo; gasped the farmer's wife, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, money! Didn't I speak plain enough?&rdquo; asked the tramp, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a thief, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you dare to call me a thief!&rdquo; said the tramp, menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you are an honest man, why do you ask that question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am going to borrow what money you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Borrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, with a grin. &ldquo;I'll hand it back when I come around
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under ordinary circumstances there would not have been money enough in the
      farmhouse to be anxious about, but it so happened that Farmer Cole had
      sold a yoke of oxen, and the money received, a hundred dollars, was
      upstairs in a bureau drawer. The thought of this, though she didn't
      suppose the tramp to be aware of it, was enough to terrify Mrs. Cole, and
      she sank back in the chair in a panic. Of course the tramp inferred that
      there was a considerable sum in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, hurry up!&rdquo; he said, roughly, &ldquo;I can't wait here all day. Where do
      you keep the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my husband's,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cole, terrified out of all prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! I'll pay it back to him. While you're about it, you may
      collect all the spoons, too. I'm going to open a boarding house,&rdquo; he
      continued, with a chuckle, &ldquo;and I shall need them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heavens! What shall I do?&rdquo; ejaculated the frightened woman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. AN EXCITING SCENE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better go upstairs and get that money, or I will go up myself,&rdquo;
       said the tramp, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cole, terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this time that Tom Tripp, looking in at the window, got an idea
      of the situation, but he was unobserved. The river bank was near, and he
      ran down to it, hoping, but not expecting, to see some one who could
      interfere with the impudent robber. We have already seen that he was
      luckier than he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs. Cole went upstairs, not knowing how to save the money from
      being carried away. She wished heartily that her husband had taken it with
      him. One hundred dollars, as she well knew, would be a serious loss to her
      husband, who was only moderately well to do. She thought it possible that
      the tramp might know how large a sum there was in the house, but could not
      be sure. She resolved, however, to make an effort to save the larger part
      of the money. From the wallet she took two five-dollar bills, and then,
      removing it from the drawer, put it between the beds. She lingered as long
      as she dared, and then went downstairs with the two bills in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you got the money?&rdquo; growled the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't take it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;be satisfied with the breakfast I have given
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a fool!&rdquo; said the tramp, rudely. &ldquo;How much have you got there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten dollars!&rdquo; said the tramp, disdainfully. &ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a large sum of money to me and my husband, sir,&rdquo; said the poor
      woman, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't enough for me! You have got more money in the house. Don't lie
      to me! You know you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not used to be talked to in that way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cole, forgetting
      her timidity for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help what you are used to; you'd better not trifle with me. Go
      upstairs and bring down the rest of the money&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, sir!'&rdquo; repeated the tramp, impatiently. &ldquo;I can't stay here all day.
      Are you going to do as I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I must,&rdquo; said the poor woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's sensible. You'll find out after a while that nothing is to be
      gained by trying to fool me. I'll give you just three minutes to find that
      money and bring it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll leave the spoons, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I want them, as I've already told you. Come, two minutes are passed.
      I don't want to kill you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cole uttered a shriek of dismay, and turned to obey the command of
      her unwelcome visitor, when a loud, clear voice was heard from just
      outside the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are, Mrs. Cole! There is help at hand. This ruffian shall
      not harm you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the voice of George Melville. The tramp turned swiftly and stared
      in ill-disguised dismay at Melville and Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo; he demanded, in a blustering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We make it our business to defend this lady from your thievish designs,&rdquo;
       said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed the tramp, contemptuously. &ldquo;Why, I could twist either of
      you round my little finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better not try it!&rdquo; said Melville, not showing the least
      trepidation. &ldquo;Mrs. Cole, has this man anything of yours in his
      possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has my spoons and I have just handed him ten dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Melville turned to the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be kind enough to lay the spoons on the table,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and give back
      the ten dollars Mrs. Cole handed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must think I'm a fool!&rdquo; said the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I think you are a prudent man. If you do as I say we will let you
      go; if not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if not?&rdquo; blustered the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, you may regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time George Melville had spoken in his usual tone of voice, and
      the tramp was puzzled to know whether he had any weapon with him. For
      himself, he was unarmed, and this made him feel rather ill at ease,
      notwithstanding his superiority in physical strength. He was rather
      disposed to think that George Melville had a pistol, for he could not
      understand how otherwise he should dare to confront a man of twice his
      size and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for the spoons,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I will take the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you will return the money,&rdquo; said Melville, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will make me?&rdquo; demanded the tramp, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see about that!&rdquo; said the tramp, desperately, and he sprang towards
      Melville, who had in the meantime entered the house and stood only six
      feet distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo; exclaimed Melville, resolutely, and he drew a
      pistol, which he leveled at his formidable antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it, stranger!&rdquo; said the tramp, &ldquo;You've got the advantage of
      me this time. Just wait till we meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to wait for some time,&rdquo; said Melville, shrugging his
      shoulders. &ldquo;I have no desire to cultivate your acquaintance, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the spoons!&rdquo; said the tramp, throwing them down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tramp looked at George Melville. Melville still held the pistol in his
      hand leveled at his breast. The thief was a large man, but he was not a
      brave one. He cowered before the resolute glance of his small opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you interfere with me if I give back the money?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me go without firing at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you won't keep your agreement,&rdquo; suggested the tramp, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a man of my word,&rdquo; said Melville, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His calm, resolute tone, free from all excitement, impressed the tramp
      with confidence. He drew the notes from his vest pocket, where he had
      thrust them, and threw them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, may I go?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer, George Melville, who stood between him and the door, drew
      aside, still, however, holding the pistol in position, and the tramp
      passed out, not sorry, it may be said, to get out of range of the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They watched him striding through the yard, and when he was fairly gone
      Mrs. Cole said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can I thank you for saving me from this wretch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to have been the instrument of deliverance,&rdquo; said Melville,
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was fortunate you had the pistol with you, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, perhaps it was,&rdquo; said Melville, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, put it up, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said the farmer's wife, &ldquo;it always makes
      me nervous to see a loaded pistol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melville bowed, and put back the pistol in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your unpleasant visitor has gone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I may as well relieve
      your fears by saying that the pistol is not loaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not loaded!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert and Tom Tripp in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it has not been loaded to my knowledge for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how could you stand up against that man?&rdquo; asked the farmer's wife,
      in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought it was loaded!&rdquo; replied Melville, &ldquo;and that answered the
      purpose. I should be very reluctant to use a loaded pistol, for I have a
      high idea of the sacredness of human life, but I have no objection to
      playing upon the fears of a man like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melville and Herbert remained at the farmhouse for half an hour, till the
      return of the farmer, when they resumed their river trip. They returned
      about noon. When they were walking through the main street, Herbert saw
      the town constable approaching with the air of a man who had business with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wish to speak to me, Mr. Bruce?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Herbert. I have a warrant for your arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my arrest!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, in amazement. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On complaint of Eben Graham, for abstracting postage stamps and money
      from the post office last evening.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. TRIED FOR THEFT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Herbert stared at the constable in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am charged with stealing stamps and money from the post office?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who makes the charge?&rdquo; demanded Herbert, in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben Graham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what it means,&rdquo; said our hero, turning to George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;that the fellow is envious of you, and angry
      because he cannot supersede you with me. He evidently wants to do you an
      injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be so; but I did not imagine that Eben could be so mean. Mr.
      Bruce, do you believe that I am a thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't, Herbert,&rdquo; said the constable, &ldquo;and it was very much against
      my will that I started out to arrest you, you may be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you want me to go with you?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go before Justice Slocum at two o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessary for me to go to the lockup?&rdquo; asked Herbert, shrinking,
      with natural repugnance, from entering the temporary house of tramps and
      law breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Herbert,&rdquo; answered the constable, in a friendly tone. &ldquo;I'll take it
      upon myself to let you go home to dinner. I will call for you at quarter
      of two. Of course I shall find you ready to accompany me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Bruce, I am impatient to meet Eben Graham, and tell him to his
      face that he has been guilty of a mean and contemptible falsehood, in
      charging me with theft. Not a person in the village who knows me will
      believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will also call at your house, Herbert,&rdquo; said George Melville, &ldquo;and
      accompany you to the office of the justice. I shall ask leave to give the
      details of Eben Graham's visit to me last evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;I am glad you do not believe a
      word of this story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so easily deceived, Herbert. It is quite possible that stamps
      and money have been stolen, but, if so, it is your false friend and
      accuser who is guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Herbert had to tell his mother what had happened. She was
      agitated and alarmed, but became calmer when Herbert told her what was
      Eben's probable motive in making the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can he behave so shamefully!&rdquo; exclaimed the indignant parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think him capable of it, myself, mother, although I had a poor
      opinion of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose that you can't prove that you are innocent, Herbert?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Carr, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for him to prove that I am guilty, mother,&rdquo; answered Herbert, who
      knew this much of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter of two Constable Bruce and Mr. Melville walked to the house
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened for them by Herbert himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you haven't taken leg bail, Herbert,&rdquo; said the constable, jocosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Bruce, I am on hand; I am in a hurry to meet Mr. Eben Graham and
      see whether he can look me in the face after his shameful behavior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bruce, I never thought you would call at my home on such an
      errand,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carr, on the point of breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry, Mrs. Carr,&rdquo; said the constable; &ldquo;anybody may be charged with
      theft, however innocent. Your son has good friends who won't see him
      treated with injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's mother was desirous of accompanying them to the office of the
      justice, but was persuaded to remain behind. Herbert knew that in her
      indignation she would not be able to be silent when she saw Eben Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Justice Slocum was an elderly man, with a mild face and gray hair. When
      Herbert entered he greeted him in a friendly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to see you here, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I am sure there is
      some mistake. I have known you ever since you were a baby, and I don't
      believe you are guilty of theft now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I submit, Judge Slocum,&rdquo; said Eben Graham, who sat in a corner, his mean
      features looking meaner and more insignificant than usual, &ldquo;I submit that
      you are prejudging the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, sir!&rdquo; said Judge Slocum, warmly. &ldquo;How dare you impugn my
      conduct? Though Herbert were my own son, I would give you a chance to
      prove him guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you'll excuse me, judge,&rdquo; said Eben, cringing. &ldquo;I am as sorry as
      you are to believe the boy guilty of stealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do your worst and say your worst, Eben Graham!&rdquo; said Herbert,
      contemptuously, &ldquo;but be very careful that you do not swear falsely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need any instructions from you, Herbert Carr, considering that
      you are a criminal on trial,&rdquo; said Eben, maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir,&rdquo; said George Melville. &ldquo;To be under arrest does
      not make a man or boy a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I am much obliged for the information, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said
      Eben, spitefully. &ldquo;You've chosen a nice companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are right,&rdquo; said Melville, gravely. &ldquo;I have done much better
      than if I had hired you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben winced, but did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Melville whispered to Herbert:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you willing to accept me as your lawyer? I am not much of one, to be
      sure, but this case is very simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very grateful for your offer, and accept it,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not propose to record the whole scene in detail, but only to give a
      general idea of the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben Graham was sworn as a witness, and deposed that he had left Herbert
      in charge of the post office the previous evening. On his return he
      examined the stamps and contents of the money drawer, and found, to his
      surprise, that five dollars in money and six dollars' worth of stamps were
      missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know they were missing?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I knew precisely how much money was in the drawer and how many
      stamps were there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you counted them just before you went out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was rather a singular time to make the count, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that it was, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should suppose the end of the day would be a more appropriate time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; answered Eben, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you led to make the count because you suspected Herbert's honesty?&rdquo;
       asked Mr. Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the very reason I did it,&rdquo; said Eben, with a malicious glance at
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it a little curious that you should have selected a boy whose
      honesty you doubted, to fill your place?&rdquo; asked George Melville,
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wasn't anybody else; he knew all about post-office work.&rdquo; answered
      Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! Now, Mr. Graham, if you have no objection, will you tell why
      you wanted to get away from the post office last evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben fidgeted, for he saw what was coming, and it made him nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted a little rest,&rdquo; he answered, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask me that question?&rdquo; asked Eben, moving about uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I desire an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where I went,&rdquo; returned Eben, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I wish you to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer the question, witness!&rdquo; said the judge, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the hotel,&rdquo; replied Eben, evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whom did you call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On you!&rdquo; answered Eben, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come to it at last. Now, what was your business with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you that Herbert would not suit you as a companion,&rdquo; said the
      witness, who thought this answer rather a clever one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you recommend in his place?&rdquo; pursued the questioner,
      relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben hesitated, but his cleverness came again to his aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that I would be willing to come just to oblige you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Herbert know that you were going to make this proposal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked him, then, to remain in the post office while you absented
      yourself with a view of depriving him of the position he had just secured
      in my employ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have got father to take him again in the store and post office,&rdquo;
       said Eben, defending himself from the implied charge of treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben nodded triumphantly. Even Melville had to admit that he was not
      treating Herbert meanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;isn't it rather strange that you should have
      been ready to recommend in your place a boy whose honesty you doubted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know he was a thief,&rdquo; said Eben, somewhat abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you suspected his honesty. That was your reason for counting the
      money and stamps before you left the office. At least, that is the reason
      you have given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had been in the office before I was there,&rdquo; said Eben, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While he was there, were any stamps missing? Was he suspected of taking
      any stamps or money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Graham, what answer did I make to your application?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What application?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take you into my employ instead of Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to keep him,&rdquo; said the witness, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Having failed, then, in your application, you went home and
      discovered that some money and stamps had been stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I was very much surprised&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, sir. Your discovery was remarkably well-timed. Herbert
      having obtained the position you sought, you straightway discovered proof
      of his dishonesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben colored, for the insinuation was plain enough for even him to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two things had nothing to do with each other!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, but I call the attention of the judge to a very remarkable
      coincidence. Have the missing stamps or money been found on the person of
      the defendant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't been searched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take it upon me to say that he is ready to submit to an
      examination,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert said, emphatically, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn't likely you'd find anything now.&rdquo; said Eben, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has had plenty of time to put 'em away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to have my mother's house searched,&rdquo; said Herbert, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they ain't there!&rdquo; said Eben, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben's answer took Herbert and his lawyer, and the judge himself, by
      surprise.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. EBEN'S TRUMP CARD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they're&mdash;a part of them&mdash;inside this letter,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he produced a letter, stamped and sealed, but not postmarked.
      The letter was addressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messrs. Jones &amp; Fitch,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;-Chestnut Street,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philadelphia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think this letter contains money or postage stamps, Mr.
      Graham?&rdquo; asked George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I've seen an advertisement of Jones &amp; Fitch in one of the
      weekly papers. They advertise to send several articles to any address on
      receipt of seventy-five cents in postage stamps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. What inference do you draw from this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see?&rdquo; answered Eben, in malicious triumph. &ldquo;That's where part
      of the stamps went. This letter was put into the post office by Herbert
      Carr this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; said Herbert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it isn't, but I guess you'll find Herbert Carr's name signed to the
      letter,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen the inside of the letter, Mr. Graham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you know Herbert Carr's name is signed to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, but I am pretty sure it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Herbert Carr wrote the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is no objection,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;I will settle the matter by
      opening it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I want you to do.&rdquo; said Eben Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melville deliberately cut open one end of the envelope with a small
      penknife, and drew out the folded sheet which it contained. As he did so,
      a small sheet of postage stamps fell upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, do you see that?&rdquo; said Eben in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheet of stamps contained twenty-five three-cent stamps, representing
      in value seventy-five cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I read the letter, sir?&rdquo; asked Melville, of the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melville read it aloud, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WAYNEBORO, August 2lst. MESSRS. JONES &amp; FITCH: I inclose seventy-five
      cents in stamps, and will be glad to have you send me the articles you
      advertise in the Weekly Gazette. Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HERBERT CARR.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert listened to the reading of this letter in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never wrote that letter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I never heard of Jones &amp;
      Fitch before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a likely story!&rdquo; sneered Eben Graham. &ldquo;I submit to Judge Slocum
      that I have proved my case. I haven't found out when all the stamps left,
      but I have shown where some are. One who will steal seventy-five cents'
      worth of stamps will steal six dollars' worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you there, Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said George Melville. &ldquo;Will you be
      kind enough to sit down at that table, and write to my dictation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I do that for?&rdquo; asked Eben, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Surely you can have no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no; I don't know as I have, though I think it's all foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, and a pen was handed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I write?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write 'Messrs. Jones &amp; Fitch.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Eben, looking discomposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my affair. Write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben wrote the words, but he seemed to find some difficulty in doing so.
      It was clear that he was trying to disguise his handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I inclose seventy-five cents in stamps,'&rdquo; proceeded George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to throw suspicion on me?&rdquo; asked Eben, throwing down the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep on writing!&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben did so, but was very deliberate about it, and seemed very particular
      as to how he penned his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;Now, I wish Herbert Carr to take the pen, and
      I will dictate the same letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert readily took the seat just vacated by Eben, and rapidly wrote the
      words dictated to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his task, Mr. Melville took the two copies, and,
      first examining them himself, handed them, together with the original
      letter, to Justice Slocum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only to ask your honor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to compare these three notes
      and decide for yourself whether the original was written by Herbert Carr
      or Mr. Eben Graham, the witness against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben Graham looked very ill at ease, flushing and paling by turns while
      the examination was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I submit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this is a very extraordinary way of treating a
      witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Justice Slocum, after a pause, said: &ldquo;I find that Mr. Eben Graham's copy
      is unmistakably in the same handwriting as the original letter, purporting
      to be written by Herbert Carr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not so!&rdquo; faltered Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said George Melville, triumphantly, &ldquo;as it seems clear that my
      young client is the victim of a base conspiracy, engineered by the man who
      has brought this charge of dishonesty against him, I have only to ask that
      he be honorably discharged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The request is granted,&rdquo; said Justice Slocum. &ldquo;Herbert, you can go. It is
      clear that you are innocent of the charge made against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest,&rdquo; began Eben Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said the justice, severely, &ldquo;I have no words to
      express my scorn and detestation of your conduct in deliberately
      contriving a plot to ruin the reputation of an innocent boy, who has never
      done you any harm. Should Herbert Carr desire it, he is at liberty to sue
      you for having him arrested on a false charge trumped up by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben began to look frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to punish Mr. Graham,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;It is enough for me
      that my honesty has been vindicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, then,&rdquo; said the justice to Eben. &ldquo;It is fortunate for you that this
      boy is so forbearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben Graham slunk out of the justice's office, looking meaner and more
      contemptible than ever, while Herbert was surrounded by his friends, who
      congratulated him upon the happy issue of the trial.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. EBEN'S LAST HOPE FAILS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ebenezer Graham had taken no stock in his son's charge against Herbert. He
      was not prejudiced in favor of Herbert, nor did he feel particularly
      friendly to him, but he was a man of shrewdness and common sense, and he
      knew that Herbert was not a fool. When Eben made known to him the fact
      that the stamps and money were missing, he said keenly: &ldquo;What has become
      of 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered Eben, &ldquo;but I can guess well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess, then,&rdquo; said his father, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Herbert Carr took my place last evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no doubt that he took the stamps and money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel sure of it&mdash;so sure that I mean to charge him with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can see what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer did not understand that Eben intended to have the boy arrested,
      and would not have consented to it had he known. But Eben slipped out of
      the store, and arranged for the arrest without his father's knowledge.
      Indeed, he did not learn till the trial had already commenced, Eben having
      made some excuse for his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Eben returned his father greeted him in a tone very far from cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Eben, I hear you've gone and made a fool of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only been defending your property, father,&rdquo; said Eben, sullenly.
      &ldquo;I thought you'd appreciate it better than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've charged an innocent boy with theft, and now all his friends will
      lay it up agin' us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you going to be robbed without saying a word?&rdquo; asked Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not, Eben Graham; I'm goin' to say a word, and now's the time to
      say it. You can't pull wool over my eyes. The money's gone, and the stamps
      are gone, and somebody's got 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert Carr!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't Herbert Carr. It's somebody nearer to me, I'm ashamed to
      say, than Herbert Carr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say I took them?&rdquo; asked Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't bring a charge unless I can prove it, but I shall watch you
      pretty closely after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I don't wish to work for you any longer; I throw up the
      situation,&rdquo; said Eben, loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verv well. When are you going to leave town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't going to leave town at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to board, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben regarded his father in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not going to send me adrift, are you?&rdquo; he asked, in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to support you in idleness; if you give up your situation
      in the store, you'll have to go to work for somebody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; thought Eben, thinking of the rich young man at the
      hotel, from whom he had sought a position as companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall have to leave Wayneboro,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there's nothing to do
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is; Farmer Collins wants a hired man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hired man!&rdquo; repeated Eben, scornfully. &ldquo;Do you think I am going&mdash;to
      hire out on a farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might do a great deal worse,&rdquo; answered Ebenezer, sensibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After being a dry-goods salesman in Boston, I haven't got down to that, I
      beg to assure you,&rdquo; said Eben, with an air of consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will have to work in the store if you expect to stay at home,&rdquo;
       said his father. &ldquo;And hark you, Eben Graham,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;don't report any
      more losses of money or stamps. I make you responsible for both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben went back to his work in an uneasy frame of mind. He saw that he had
      not succeeded in imposing upon his father, and that the clear-sighted old
      gentleman strongly suspected where the missing articles had gone. Eben
      might have told, had he felt inclined, that the five-dollar bill had been
      mailed to a lottery agent in New York in payment for a ticket in a
      Southern lottery, and that the stamps were even now in his possession, and
      would be sold at the first opportunity. His plan to throw suspicion upon
      Herbert had utterly failed, and the cold looks with which he had been
      greeted showed what the villagers thought of his attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't stay in Wayneboro much longer,&rdquo; Eben inwardly resolved. &ldquo;It's the
      dullest hole in creation. I can get along somehow in a large place, but
      here there's positively nothing. Hire out on a farm, indeed! My father
      ought to be ashamed to recommend such a thing to his only son, when he's
      so well off. If he would only give me two hundred dollars, I would go to
      California and trouble him no more. Plenty of people make money in
      California, and why shouldn't I? If that ticket draws a prize&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Eben went into calculations of what he would do if only he drew a
      prize of a thousand dollars. That wasn't too much to expect, for there
      were several of that amount, and several considerably larger. He pictured
      how independent he would be with his prize, and how he would tell his
      father that he could get along without him, displaying at the same time a
      large roll of bills. When he reached California he could buy an interest
      in a mine, and perhaps within three or four years he could return home
      twenty times as rich as his father. It was pleasant to think over all
      this, and almost to persuade himself that the good luck had actually come.
      However, he must wait a few days, for the ticket had not yet come, and the
      lottery would not be drawn for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ticket arrived two days later; Eben took care to slip the envelope
      into his pocket without letting his father or anyone else see it, for
      unpleasant questions might have been asked as to where he got the money
      that paid for it, Mr. Graham knowing very well that his son had not five
      dollars by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few days Eben must remain in Wayneboro, until the lottery was drawn.
      If he was unlucky, he would have to consider some other plan for raising
      money to get away from Wayneboro.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the day after the trial and his triumphant acquittal, that
      Herbert saw Eben. He came to the store to buy some groceries for his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Herbert,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben,&rdquo; said Herbert, coldly, &ldquo;except in the way of business, I don't want
      to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't bear malice on account of that little affair, do you, Herbert?&rdquo;
       said Eben, smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little affair, as you call it, might have been a very serious affair
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only did my duty,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it your duty to charge an innocent person with theft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't see who else could have taken the things,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably you know as well as anybody,&rdquo; said Herbert, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Eben, coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know better than I do. How much do I owe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-three cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is your money,&rdquo; said Herbert, and walked out of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate that boy!&rdquo; said Eben, scowling at Herbert's retreating figure. &ldquo;He
      puts on too many airs, just because a city man's taken him in charity and
      is paying his expenses. Some time I'll be able to come up with him, I
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not of an unforgiving nature, but he felt that Eben had
      wronged him deeply, and saw no reason why he would not repeat the injury
      if he ever got the chance. He had at least a partial understanding of
      Eben's mean nature and utter selfishness, and felt that he wished to have
      nothing to do with him. Ebenezer Graham was very &ldquo;close,&rdquo; but he was a
      hard-working man and honest as the world goes. He was tolerably respected
      in Wayneboro, though not popular, but Eben seemed on the high road to
      become a rascal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week slipped by, and a circular containing the list of prizes drawn was
      sent to Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran his eyes over it in a flutter of excitement. Alas! for his hopes.
      In the list of lucky numbers the number on his ticket was not included.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have drawn a blank! Curse the luck!&rdquo; he muttered, savagely. &ldquo;The old
      man needn't think I am going to stay here in Wayneboro. If he won't give
      me money to go out West, why, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not say what then.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. A TRIP TO BOSTON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Herbert,&rdquo; said George Melville, as they parted for the day, &ldquo;I
      shall propose a new excursion to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert regarded him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go to Boston to make a few purchases, but principally to
      consult my physician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not feeling any worse, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, with
      genuine concern, for he had come to feel a regard for his employer, who
      was always kind and considerate to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am feeling as well as usual; but I wish to consult Dr. Davies about
      the coming winter&mdash;whether he would advise me to spend it in
      Massachusetts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Melville goes away, I shall have to look for another place,&rdquo;
       thought Herbert, soberly. It was hardly likely, he knew, that he would
      obtain a position so desirable as the one he now filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will be able to do so, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; he said, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so; but I shall not be surprised if the doctor ordered me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won't want me to come to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, unless you object to going to Boston with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Object?&rdquo; repeated Herbert, eagerly. &ldquo;I should like nothing better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, our hero, though a well-grown boy of sixteen, had never been to
      Boston but three times, and the trip, commonplace as it may seem to my
      traveled young readers, promised him a large amount of novelty and
      pleasurable excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad of your company, Herbert. I hardly feel the strength or
      enterprise to travel alone, even for so trifling a trip as going to
      Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour will you go, Mr. Melville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take the second train, at nine o'clock. It will afford me time
      enough, and save my getting up before my usual time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert would have preferred going by the first train, starting at
      half-past seven, as it would have given him a longer day in the city, but
      of course he felt that his employer had decided wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be quite a treat to me, going to Boston,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have only
      been there three times in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly have not been much of a traveler, Herbert,&rdquo; said George
      Melville, smiling. &ldquo;However, you are young, and you may see a good deal of
      the world yet before you die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I will. It must be delightful to travel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when you are young and strong,&rdquo; said Melville, thoughtfully. &ldquo;That
      makes a great deal of difference in the enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not fail to put in an appearance at the hotel considerably
      before it was time to leave for the train. George Melville smiled at his
      punctuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, Herbert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I could look forward with as much
      pleasure as you feel to our trip to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish so, too, Mr. Melville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I shall enjoy it better for having a companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tickets were bought, and they took their places in one of the
      passenger cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the train was ready to start, Herbert saw a young man with a
      ticket in his hand hurrying along the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there's Eben Graham!&rdquo; he said, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he entering the cars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has just got into the car behind us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he is going to leave Wayneboro for good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he is only going to Boston for the day, perhaps to buy goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert thought it doubtful whether Ebenezer Graham would trust his son so
      far, but did not say so. Eben, on his part, had not seen Herbert on board
      the train, and was not aware that he was a fellow passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey was a tolerably long one&mdash;forty miles&mdash;and consumed
      an hour and a half. At last they rolled into the depot, and before the
      train had fairly stopped the passengers began to crowd toward the doors of
      the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us remain till the crowd has passed out,&rdquo; said George Melville. &ldquo;It
      is disagreeable to me to get into the throng, and it saves very little
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking out of the car window, Herbert saw Eben Graham walking swiftly
      along the platform, and could not forbear wondering what had brought him
      to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My doctor's office is on Tremont Street,&rdquo; said Mr. Melville. &ldquo;I shall go
      there immediately, and may have to wait some time. It will be tiresome to
      you, and I shall let you go where you please. You can meet me at the
      Parker House, in School Street, at two o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where the hotel is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I can find it,&rdquo; answered Herbert, confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I will also get you to attend to a part of my business for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad to do so,&rdquo; said Herbert, sincerely. It made him feel
      more important to be transacting business in Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a check for a hundred and fifty dollars on the Merchants' Bank,&rdquo;
       continued George Melville. &ldquo;It is payable to the bearer, and you will have
      no trouble in getting the money on it. You may present it at the bank, and
      ask for fives and tens and a few small bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert felt rather proud to have so much confidence reposed in him, for
      to him a hundred and fifty dollars seemed a large sum of money, and he
      felt that George Melville was a rich man to draw so much at one time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I better go to the bank at once?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so; of course, I need not caution you to take good care of
      the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be sure to do that, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked together to Tremont Street, and Mr. Melville paused at a
      doorway opposite the Common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My doctor's office is upstairs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will part here and meet at
      the hotel. If you are late, I may go into the dining room; so if you don't
      see me in the reading room, go to the door of the dining room and look
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir; but I think I shall be on time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bank is open now, and you can cash the check if you go down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, Herbert walked slowly along, looking into shop windows
      and observing with interested attention the people whom he met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very pleasant to live in the city,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;there is so
      much going on all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is no wonder that country boys are drawn toward the city, and feel that
      their cup of happiness would be full if they could get a position in some
      city store. They do not always find the reality equal to their
      anticipations. The long hours and strict discipline of a city office or
      mercantile establishment are not much like the freedom they pictured to
      themselves, and after they have paid their board bill in some shabby
      boarding house they seldom find much left over, either for amusement or
      needful expenses. The majority of boys would do better to remain in their
      country homes, where at least they can live comfortably and at small
      expense, and take such employment as may fall in their way. They will
      stand a much better chance of reaching a competence in middle life than if
      they helped to crowd the ranks of city clerks and salesmen. There is many
      a hard-working clerk of middle age, living poorly, and with nothing laid
      by, in the city, who, had he remained in his native village, might have
      reached a modest independence. It was hardly to be expected, however, that
      Herbert would feel thus. Upon him the show and glitter of the city shops
      and streets produced their natural effect, and he walked on buoyantly,
      seeing three times as much as a city boy would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned down School Street, passing the Parker House, where he was to
      meet Mr. Melville. Just before he reached it he saw Eben Graham emerge
      from the hotel and walk towards Washington Street. Eben did not look
      behind him, and therefore did not see Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where he is going?&rdquo; thought our hero, as he followed a few steps
      behind Eben.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. AN OBLIGING GUIDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Washington Street, not far from Old South Church, is an office for the
      sale of railroad tickets to western points. It was this office which Eben
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to inquire the price of a ticket to some western city,&rdquo;
       thought Herbert. &ldquo;I heard him say one day that he wanted to go West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our hero's curiosity was naturally aroused, and he stood at the entrance,
      where he could not only see but hear what passed within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you charge for a ticket to Chicago?&rdquo; he heard Eben ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-two dollars,&rdquo; was the answer of the young man behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may give me one,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he drew from his vest pocket a roll of bills, and began to
      count off the requisite sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was surprised. He had supposed that Eben was merely making
      inquiries about the price of tickets. He had not imagined that he was
      really going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can Mr. Graham have given him money to go?&rdquo; he asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I start?&rdquo; asked Eben, as he received a string of tickets from
      the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At three this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben seemed well pleased with this reply. He carefully deposited the
      tickets in an inside vest pocket, and turned to go out of the office. As
      he emerged from it he caught sight of Herbert, who had not yet started to
      go. He looked surprised and annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert Carr!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How came you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mingled with his surprise there was a certain nervousness of manner, as
      Herbert thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to Boston with Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; ejaculated Eben, with an air of perceptible relief. &ldquo;Where is Mr.
      Melville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone to the office of his physician, on Tremont Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving you to your own devices, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out you don't get lost!&rdquo; said Eben, with affected gayety. &ldquo;I am here
      on a little business for the old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not believe this, in view of what he had seen, but he did not
      think it necessary to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo; said Herbert, in a tone polite but not cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning! Oh, by the way, I have just been inquiring the cost of a
      ticket to St. Louis,&rdquo; said Eben, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Do you think of going out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if the old man will let me,&rdquo; said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you prefer St. Louis to Chicago?&rdquo; asked Herbert, watching the face of
      Eben attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben's face changed, and he looked searchingly at our hero, but could read
      nothing in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, decidedly!&rdquo; he answered, after a slight pause. &ldquo;I don't think I would
      care for Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all the while you have a ticket for Chicago in your pocket!&rdquo; thought
      Herbert, suspiciously, &ldquo;Well, that's your own affair entirely, not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What train do you take back to Wayneboro?&rdquo; asked Eben, not without
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not go before four o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be on the train with you,&rdquo; said Eben, &ldquo;though possibly I shall get
      through in time to take an earlier one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is trying to deceive me,&rdquo; thought Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said, formally, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I hadn't met him,&rdquo; muttered Eben to himself. &ldquo;He may give the old
      man a clew. However, I shall be safe out of the way before anything can be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert kept on his way, and found the bank without difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered and looked about him. Though unaccustomed to banks, he watched
      to see where others went to get checks cashed, and presented himself in
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will you have it?&rdquo; asked the paying teller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fives and tens, and a few small bills,&rdquo; answered Herbert, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The teller selected the requisite number of bank bills quickly, and passed
      them out to Herbert. Our hero counted them, to make sure that they were
      correct, and then put them away in his inside pocket. It gave him a
      feeling of responsibility to be carrying about so much money, and he felt
      that it was incumbent on him to be very careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I go now?&rdquo; he asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to go to Charlestown, and ascend Bunker Hill Monument,
      but did not know how to go. Besides, he feared he would not get back to
      the Parker House at the time fixed by Mr. Melville. Still, he might be
      able to do it. He addressed himself to a rather sprucely dressed man of
      thirty-five whom he met at the door of the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but can you tell me how far it is to Bunker Hill
      Monument?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a mile and a half,&rdquo; answered the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I go there and get back to the Parker House before one o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you?&rdquo; repeated the man, briskly. &ldquo;Why, to be sure you could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't know the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only to take one of the Charlestown horse cars, and it will land
      you only a couple of minutes' walk from the monument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me what time it is, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little past eleven. So you have never been to Bunker Hill
      Monument, my lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sir; I live in the country, forty miles away and seldom come to
      Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; said the stranger, his eyes snapping in a very peculiar
      way. &ldquo;Every patriotic young American ought to see the place where Warren
      fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to if you could tell me where to take the cars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly I will,&rdquo; said the other, quickly. &ldquo;In fact&mdash;let me
      see,&rdquo; and he pulled out a silver watch from his vest pocket, &ldquo;I've a great
      mind to go over with you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't like to trouble you, sir,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will be no trouble. Business isn't pressing this morning, and I
      haven't been over for a long time myself. If you don't object to my
      company, I will accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;If you are quite sure that you are not
      inconveniencing yourself, I shall be very glad to go with you&mdash;that
      is, if you think I can get back to the Parker House by one o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will guarantee that you do,&rdquo; said the stranger, confidently. &ldquo;My young
      friend, I am glad to see that you are particular to keep your business
      engagements. In a varied business experience, I have observed that it is
      precisely that class who are destined to win the favor of their employer
      and attain solid success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems a very sensible man,&rdquo; thought Herbert; &ldquo;and his advice is
      certainly good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said the stranger, crossing Washington Street. &ldquo;Scollay's
      Square is close at hand, and there we shall find a Charlestown horse car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Herbert yielded himself to the guidance of his new friend, and
      they walked up Court Street together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the stranger, pointing out a large, somber building to the
      left, &ldquo;is the courthouse. The last time I entered it was to be present at
      the trial of a young man of my acquaintance who had fallen into evil
      courses, and, yielding to temptation, had stolen from his employer. It was
      a sad sight,&rdquo; said the stranger, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it must have been,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why, why will young men yield to the seductions of pleasure?&rdquo;
       exclaimed the stranger, feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he convicted?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and sentenced to a three years term in the State prison,&rdquo; answered
      his companion. &ldquo;It always makes me feel sad when I think of the fate of
      that young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it would, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have mentioned it as a warning to one who is just beginning life,&rdquo;
       continued the stranger. &ldquo;But here is our car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Charlestown car, with an outside sign, Bunker Hill, in large letters,
      came by, and the two got on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode down Cornhill, and presently the stranger pointed out Faneuil
      Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the Cradle of Liberty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course, you have heard of
      Faneuil Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and Herbert gazed with interest at the building of which he
      had heard so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a short ride to Charlestown. They got out at the foot of a
      steep street, at the head of which the tall, granite column which crowns
      the summit of Bunker Hill stood like a giant sentinel ever on guard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. A NEW BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just opposite the monument is a small, one-story structure, where views of
      the shaft may be purchased and tickets obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a small admission fee,&rdquo; said Herbert's companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo; asked our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Herbert thrust his hand into his pocket for the necessary money, his
      companion said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better let me pay for both tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though he said this, he didn't make any motion to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will pay for both,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I really cannot permit you to pay for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still the speaker made no movement to purchase his ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert settled the matter by laying half a dollar on the desk, and asking
      for two tickets. He began to see that, in spite of his disclaimer, his
      guide intended him to do so. On the whole, this didn't please him. He
      would rather have had his offer frankly accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to have you pay,&rdquo; said the young man, as they passed
      through the door admitting them to an inner apartment, from which there
      was an exit into a small, inclosed yard, through which they were to reach
      the entrance to a spiral staircase by which the ascent was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not answer, for he understood that his guide was not telling
      the truth, and he did not like falsehood or deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the monument and commenced the ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a tiresome ascent before us,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many steps are there?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three hundred,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At different points in the ascent they came to landings where they could
      catch glimpses of the outward world through long, narrow, perpendicular
      slits in the sides of the monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they reached the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's guide looked about him sharply, and seemed disappointed to find
      a lady and gentleman and child also enjoying the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had never been so high before. Indeed, he had never been in any
      high building, and he looked about him with a novel sense of enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine view there is here!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; assented his companion. &ldquo;Let me point out to you the different
      towns visible to the naked eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So his guide pointed out Cambridge, Chelsea, Malden, the Charles and
      Mystic Rivers, gleaming in the sunshine, the glittering dome of the Boston
      State House and other conspicuous objects. Herbert felt that it was worth
      something to have a companion who could do him this service, and he felt
      the extra twenty cents he had paid for his companion's ticket was a
      judicious investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed with some surprise that his companion seemed annoyed by the
      presence of the other party already referred to. He scowled and shrugged
      his shoulders when he looked at them, and in a low voice, inaudible to
      those of whom he spoke, he said to Herbert: &ldquo;Are they going to stay here
      all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter to me if they do?&rdquo; returned Herbert, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, to him they seemed very pleasant people, and he was especially
      attracted by the sweet face of the little girl. He wished he had been
      fortunate enough to possess such a sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, they finished their sightseeing, and prepared to
      descend. Herbert's companion waited till the sound of their descending
      steps died away, and then, turning to Herbert, said in a quick, stern
      tone: &ldquo;Now give me the money you have in your pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert recoiled, and stared at the speaker in undisguised astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean just what I say,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;You have one hundred and
      fifty dollars in your pocket. You need not deny it, for I saw you draw it
      from the bank and put it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a thief, then?&rdquo; demanded Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what I am, I must have that money,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;I came
      over with you exclusively to get it, and I mean business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a step towards Herbert, but the boy faced him unflinchingly, and
      answered resolutely: &ldquo;I mean business, too. The money is not mine, and I
      shall not give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said the other, menacingly, &ldquo;we are alone here. You are a boy
      and I am a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that; but you will have to fight to get the money,&rdquo; said Herbert,
      without quailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked to the staircase, but his treacherous guide stood between him
      and it, and he was practically a prisoner at the top of the monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool!&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;You may as well give up the money
      to me first as last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't propose to give it up to you at all,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;My employer
      trusted me with it, and I mean to be true to my trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell him that it was taken from you&mdash;that you could not help
      yourself. Now hand it over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see about that,&rdquo; said his companion, seizing the boy and grappling
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was a strong boy for his age, and he accepted the challenge.
      Though his antagonist was a man, he found that the boy was powerful, and
      not to be mastered as easily as he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I wish I had a knife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Herbert made a vigorous resistance, his opponent was his superior
      in strength, and would ultimately have got the better of him. He had
      thrown Herbert down, and was trying to thrust his hand into his coat
      pocket, when a step was heard, and a tall man of Western appearance
      stepped on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, surveying the two combatants in surprise. &ldquo;What's all
      this? Let that boy alone, you skunk, you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he seized the man by the collar and jerked him to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; he asked, turning from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This boy has robbed me of one hundred and fifty dollars,&rdquo; said the man,
      glibly. &ldquo;I fell in with him in the Boston cars, and he relieved me of a
      roll of bills which I had drawn from a bank in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got to say to this?&rdquo; asked the Western man, turning to
      Herbert, who was now on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; answered Herbert, &ldquo;that it is a lie. It was I who drew the
      money from the Merchants' Bank in Boston. This man saw me cash the check,
      followed me, and offered to come here with me, when I asked him for
      directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a likely story!&rdquo; sneered the young man. &ldquo;My friend here is too
      sharp to believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't call me your friend!&rdquo; said the Western man, bluntly. &ldquo;I'm more than
      half convinced you're a scamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't propose to stay here and be insulted. Let the boy give me my
      money, and I won't have him arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be in too much of a hurry, young man! I want to see about this
      thing. What bank did you draw the money from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Merchants' Bank&mdash;the boy has got things reversed. He saw me
      draw it, inveigled himself into my confidence, and picked my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;stop right there! Your story doesn't hang together!&rdquo; said
      the tall Westerner, holding up his finger. &ldquo;You said you met this boy in a
      horse car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came over together in a Charlestown horse car,&rdquo; said the rogue,
      abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've given yourself away. Now make yourself scarce! Scoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rascal looked in the face of the tall, resolute man from the West, and
      thought it prudent to obey. He started to descend, but a well-planted kick
      accelerated his progress, and he fell down several steps, bruising his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir!&rdquo; said Herbert, gratefully. &ldquo;It was lucky you came up just
      as you did. The rascal had got his hand on the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a miserable scamp!&rdquo; answered Herbert's new friend. &ldquo;If there'd been
      a police-man handy, I'd have given him in charge. I've come clear from
      Wisconsin to see where Warren fell, but I didn't expect to come across
      such a critter as that on Bunker Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert pointed out to his new friend the objects in view, repeating the
      information he had so recently acquired. Then, feeling that he could spare
      no more time, he descended the stairs and jumped on board a horse car
      bound for Boston.

      CHAPTER XVII. AN ACCEPTABLE PRESENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the clock at the Old South Church struck one, Herbert ascended the
      steps of Parker's Hotel, and walked into the reading room. George Melville
      was already there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are on time, Herbert,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, as our hero made his
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but I began to think I should miss my appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Bunker Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ascend the monument?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and had a fight at the summit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melville looked at Herbert in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had a fight at the top of Bunker Hill Monument?&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; let me tell you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the story was told, Mr. Melville said: &ldquo;That was certainly a
      remarkable adventure, Herbert. Still, I am not sorry that it occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Herbert's turn to look surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you why. It proves to me that you are worthy of my
      confidence, and can be trusted with the care of money. It has also taught
      you a lesson, to beware of knaves, no matter how plausible they may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't got over my surprise yet, sir, at discovering the real
      character of the man who went with me. I am sorry I met him. I don't like
      to distrust people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I. But it is not necessary to distrust everybody. In your journey
      through the world you will make many agreeable and trustworthy
      acquaintances in whom it will be safe to confide. It is only necessary to
      be cautious and not give your confidence too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn't mention that I met somebody from Wayneboro,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it Eben Graham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him myself on Washington Street. Did you speak to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he goes back to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think he will go back at all, Mr. Melville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His employer looked at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him buy a ticket to Chicago, though he does not know it,&rdquo; continued
      Herbert. &ldquo;When he spoke with me he didn't admit it, but spoke of going
      back by an afternoon train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he has appropriated some of his father's funds,&rdquo; said
      Melville. &ldquo;I doubt if Ebenezer Graham would voluntarily furnish him the
      means of going West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was just what occurred to me,&rdquo; said Herbert; &ldquo;but I didn't like to
      think that Eben would steal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has not. We shall be likely to hear when we return. But you
      must be hungry. We will go in to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert followed Mr. Melville into the dining room, where a good dinner
      was ordered, and partaken of. Herbert looked over the bill of fare, but
      the high prices quite startled him. He was not used to patronizing hotels,
      and it seemed to him that the price asked for a single dish ought to be
      enough to pay for a whole dinner for two. He knew about what it cost for a
      meal at home, and did not dream that it would amount to so much more at a
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the check was brought Herbert looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two dollars and a half!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It costs an awful amount to live in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh a dinner can be got much cheaper at most places in Boston,&rdquo; said
      George Melville, smiling, &ldquo;but I am used to Parker's, and generally come
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad it doesn't cost so much to live in Wayneboro,&rdquo; said Herbert.
      &ldquo;We couldn't afford even one meal a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't asked me what the doctor said,&rdquo; remarked Melville, as they
      left the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Melville. It wasn't from any lack of interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He advises me to go West by the first of October, either to Colorado or
      Southern California.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's countenance fell. The first of October would soon come, and his
      pleasant and profitable engagement with Mr. Melville would close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sorry as I should have been a few weeks ago,&rdquo; said Melville.
      &ldquo;Then I should have looked forward to a journey as lonely and monotonous.
      Now, with a companion, I think I may have a pleasant time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is going with you, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; asked Herbert, feeling, it must be
      confessed, a slight twinge of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps you would be willing to accompany me,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you really take me, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; cried Herbert, joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like nothing better. I have always wanted to travel. It quite
      takes my breath away to think of going so far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hardly venture to go alone,&rdquo; continued George Melville. &ldquo;I shall
      need some one to look after the details of the journey, and to look after
      me if I fall sick. Do you think you would be willing to do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't fall sick, Mr. Melville; but if you do, I will take the
      best care of you I know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will, Herbert, and I would rather have you about me than a
      man. Indeed, I already begin to think of you as a younger brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, gratefully. &ldquo;I am glad you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think your mother will object to your leaving home, Herbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with you. She knows I shall be well provided for with you. Can I
      arrange to send money regularly to mother?&rdquo; asked the boy. &ldquo;I shouldn't
      like to think of her as suffering for want of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but to guard against emergencies, we can leave her a sum of money
      before you start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Mr. Melville proposed to Herbert to accompany him on a walk
      up Washington Street, They walked slowly, Herbert using his eyes
      diligently, for to him the display in the shop windows was novel and
      attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they paused at the door of a large and handsome jewelry store&mdash;one
      of the two finest in Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go in here, Herbert,&rdquo; said his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I stay outside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, come in with me. You may like to look about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Herbert had no idea of the cost of the fine stock with which the
      store was provided, he saw that it must be valuable, and wondered where
      purchasers enough could be found to justify keeping so large a supply of
      watches, chains, rings and the numberless other articles in gold and
      silver which he saw around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to look at your watches,&rdquo; said Melville to the salesman who
      came forward to inquire his wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold or silver, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to a case where through the glass covering Herbert saw
      dozens of silver watches of all sizes and grades lying ready for
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what price can I get a fair silver watch?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swiss or Waltham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waltham. I may as well patronize home manufactures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a watch I will sell you for fifteen dollars,&rdquo; said the salesman,
      drawing out a neat-looking watch, of medium size. &ldquo;It will keep excellent
      time, and give you good satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I will buy it on your recommendation. Have you any silver
      chains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One was selected of pretty pattern, and George Melville paid for both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like the watch and chain, Herbert?&rdquo; said his employer, as they
      left the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very pretty, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wonder what I want of two watches,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don't like to take your gold watch with you when you go out
      West, for fear of thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is not the reason. If I am so unfortunate as to lose my gold
      watch, I will buy another. The fact is, I have bought this silver watch
      and chain for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, intensely delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it will be convenient for you, as well as me, to be provided with a
      watch. Every traveler needs one. There; put it in your pocket, and see how
      it looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind to me, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, gratefully. &ldquo;You
      couldn't have bought me anything which I should value more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Herbert had arranged the watch and chain to suit him, it must be
      confessed that it engrossed a large part of his attention, and it was
      wonderful how often he had occasion to consult it during the first walk
      after it came into his possession.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. A THIEF IN TROUBLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever visited the suburbs of Boston?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Herbert. &ldquo;I know very little of the city, and nothing of
      the towns near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as we have time to spare, we will board the next horse car and ride
      out to Roxbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it very much, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, in a tone of
      satisfaction. I may remark that Roxbury was at that time a separate
      municipality, and had not been annexed to Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not have to wait long for a car. An open car, of the kind in
      common use during the pleasant season, drew near, and they secured seats
      in it. After leaving Dover Street, Washington Street, still then narrow,
      broadens into a wide avenue, and is called the Neck. It was gay with
      vehicles of all sorts, and Herbert found much to attract his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor tells me I ought to be a good deal in the open air,&rdquo; said
      Melville, &ldquo;and I thought I would act at once upon his suggestion. It is
      much pleasanter than taking medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; answered Herbert, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the end of the route, Melville and Herbert remained on the car,
      and returned at once to the city. When they reached the crowded part of
      Washington Street a surprise awaited Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a small jewelry store they saw a man come out, and walk rapidly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, in excitement, &ldquo;do you see that man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the man who tried to rob me on Bunker Hill Monument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly uttered these words when another man darted from the shop,
      bareheaded, and pursued Herbert's morning acquaintance, crying, &ldquo;Stop,
      thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thief took to his heels, but a policeman was at hand, and seized him
      by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has this man been doing?&rdquo; he asked, as the jeweler's clerk came up,
      panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has stolen a diamond ring from the counter,&rdquo; answered the clerk. &ldquo;I
      think he has a watch besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a lie!&rdquo; said the thief, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search him!&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;and you'll find that I have made no
      mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me to the station house, and prepare your complaint,&rdquo; said the
      policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time a crowd had gathered, and the thief appealed to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a reputable citizen of St. Louis, come to
      Boston to buy goods, and I protest against this outrage. It is either a
      mistake or a conspiracy, I don't know which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thief was well dressed, and some of the bystanders were disposed to
      put confidence in him. He had not seen Herbert and George Melville, who
      had left the car and joined the throng, or he might not have spoken so
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't look like a thief,&rdquo; said one of the bystanders, a
      benevolent-looking old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; said the thief, more boldly. &ldquo;It's a pretty state of
      things if a respectable merchant can't enter a store here in Boston
      without being insulted and charged with theft. If I only had some of my
      friends or acquaintances here, they would tell you that it is simply
      ridiculous to make such a charge against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can explain this at the station house,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;It is my
      duty to take you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no one who knows the gentleman?&rdquo; said the philanthropist before
      referred to. &ldquo;Is there no one to speak up for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert pressed forward, and said, quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something of him; I passed the morning in his company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thief turned quickly, but he didn't seem gratified to see Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy is mistaken,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly; &ldquo;I never saw him before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have seen you, sir,&rdquo; retorted our hero. &ldquo;You saw me draw some money
      from a bank in State Street, scraped acquaintance with me, and tried to
      rob me of it on Bunker Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a lie!&rdquo; said the prisoner, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to make a charge to that effect?&rdquo; asked the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I only mentioned what I knew of him to support the charge of
      this gentleman,&rdquo; indicating the jeweler's clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman appeared to lose his interest in the prisoner after
      Herbert's statement, and he was escorted without further delay to the
      station house, where a gold watch and the diamond ring were both found on
      his person. It is scarcely needful to add that he was tried and sentenced
      to a term of imprisonment in the very city&mdash;Charlestown&mdash;where
      he had attempted to rob Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not always that retribution so quickly overtakes the wrongdoer,&rdquo;
       said Melville. &ldquo;St. Louis will hardly be proud of the man who claims her
      citizenship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dishonesty doesn't seem to pay in his case,&rdquo; said Herbert, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never pays in any case, Herbert,&rdquo; said George Melville, emphatically.
      &ldquo;Even if a man could steal enough to live upon, and were sure not to be
      found out, he would not enjoy his ill-gotten gain, as an honest man enjoys
      the money he works hard for. But when we add the risk of detection and the
      severe penalty of imprisonment, it seems a fatal mistake for any man to
      overstep the bounds of honesty and enroll himself as a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I don't
      think I shall ever be tempted, but if I am, I will think of this man and
      his quick detection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the depot, a little before four o'clock, George Melville
      sent Herbert to the ticket office to purchase tickets, while he remained
      in the waiting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might as well accustom you to the duties that are likely to devolve
      upon you,&rdquo; he said, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had purchased the tickets and was turning away, when to his
      surprise he saw Ebenezer Graham enter the depot, laboring evidently under
      considerable excitement. He did not see Herbert, so occupied was he with
      thoughts of an unpleasant nature, till the boy greeted him respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert Carr!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;when did you come into Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen anything of my son, Eben, here?&rdquo; gasped Mr. Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; he was on the same train, but I did not see him to speak to him
      till after I reached the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what he has been doing here?&rdquo; asked Ebenezer, his face
      haggard with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only saw him for five minutes,&rdquo; answered Herbert, reluctant to tell the
      father what he knew would confirm any suspicion he might entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you see him?&rdquo; demanded Ebenezer, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a railroad ticket office not far from the Old South Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know if he bought any ticket?&rdquo; asked Ebenezer, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Herbert. &ldquo;I overheard him purchasing a ticket to Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer groaned, and his face seemed more and more wizened and puckered
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as I thought!&rdquo; he exclaimed, bitterly. &ldquo;My own son has robbed me
      and fled like a thief, as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was shocked, but not surprised. He didn't like to ask particulars,
      but Ebenezer volunteered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I foolishly gave Eben a hundred dollars, and
      sent him to Boston to pay for a bill of goods which I recently bought of a
      wholesale house on Milk Street. If I had only known you were going in, I
      would have sent it by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert felt gratified at this manifestation of confidence, especially as
      he had so recently been charged with robbing the post office, but did not
      interrupt Mr. Graham, who continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as Eben was fairly gone, I began to feel sorry I sent him, for he
      got into extravagant ways when he was in Boston before, and he had been
      teasing me to give him money enough to go out West with. About noon I
      discovered that he had taken fifty dollars more than the amount I
      intrusted to him, and then I couldn't rest till I was on my way to Boston
      to find out the worst. I went to the house on Milk Street and found they
      had seen nothing of Eben. Then I knew what had happened. The graceless boy
      has robbed his father of a hundred and fifty dollars, and is probably on
      his way West by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was to start by the three o'clock train, I think,&rdquo; said Herbert, and
      gave his reasons for thinking so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer seemed so utterly cast down by this confirmation of his worst
      suspicions, that Herbert called Mr. Melville, thinking he might be able to
      say something to comfort him.

      CHAPTER XIX. EBENEZER GRAHAM'S GRIEF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much have you lost by your son, Mr. Graham?&rdquo; asked George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly two hundred and fifty dollars,&rdquo; groaned Ebenezer, &ldquo;counting what I
      paid in the city to his creditors, it is terrible, terrible!&rdquo; and he wrung
      his hands in his bitterness of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for you,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;and still more for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be sorry for him?&rdquo; demanded Ebenezer, sharply. &ldquo;He hasn't
      lost anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it nothing to lose his consciousness of integrity, to leave his home
      knowing that he is a thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little he'll care for that!&rdquo; said Mr. Graham, shrugging his shoulders.
      &ldquo;He's laughing in his sleeve, most likely, at the way he has duped and
      cheated me, his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is Eben, Mr. Graham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be twenty in November,&rdquo; answered Ebenezer, apparently puzzled by
      the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as he is so young, let us hope that he may see the error of his
      ways, and repent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't bring me back my money,&rdquo; objected Ebenezer, querulously. It
      was clear that he thought more of the money he had lost than of his son's
      lack of principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it will not give you back your money, but it may give you back a son
      purified and prepared to take an honorable position in society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; he's bad, bad!&rdquo; said the stricken father. &ldquo;What did he care for
      the labor and toil it took to save up that money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the loss of the money will not distress you, Mr. Graham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not exactly,&rdquo; said Ebenezer, hesitating. &ldquo;I shall have to take
      some money from the savings bank to make up what that graceless boy has
      stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that Ebenezer Graham would not have to go to the poorhouse in
      consequence of his losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly offer you consolation,&rdquo; said George Melville, &ldquo;but I suspect
      that you will not be called upon to pay any more money for your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to!&rdquo; said Ebenezer, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away as he has done, he will find it necessary to support himself,
      and will hardly have courage to send to you for assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him try it!&rdquo; said Ebenezer, his eyes snapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may, therefore, being thrown upon his own resources, be compelled to
      work hard, and that will probably be the best thing that can happen to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will! I hope he will!&rdquo; said the storekeeper. &ldquo;He may find out
      after a while that he had an easy time at home, and was better paid than
      he will be among strangers. I won't pay any more of his debts. I'll
      publish a notice saying that I have given him his time, and won't pay any
      more debts of his contracting. He might run into debt enough to ruin me,
      between now and the time he becomes of age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Melville considered that the storekeeper was justified in taking
      this step, and said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were on the train, Ebenezer got measurably reconciled to his
      loss, and his busy brain began to calculate how much money he would save
      by ceasing to be responsible for Eben's expenses of living and prospective
      debts. Without this drawback, he knew he would grow richer every year. He
      knew also that notwithstanding the sum it had just cost him, he would be
      better off at the end of the year than the beginning, and to a man of his
      character this was perhaps the best form of consolation that he could
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it occurred to Mr. Graham that he should need a clerk in place of
      his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that Eben has gone, Herbert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am ready to take you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a surprise, for Herbert had not thought of the effect upon his
      own business prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got a place, thank you, Mr. Graham,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't call trampin' round huntin' and fishin' work, do you?&rdquo; said
      Ebenezer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very agreeable work, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it stands to reason that you can't earn much that way. I wouldn't
      give you twenty-five cents a week for such doings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you willing to pay me more than Mr. Melville does?&rdquo; asked Herbert,
      demurely, smiling to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much does he pay you now?&rdquo; asked Ebenezer, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six dollars a week!&rdquo; repeated the storekeeper, in incredulous amazement.
      &ldquo;Sho! you're joking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can ask Mr. Melville, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer regarded George Melville with an inquiring look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I pay Herbert six dollars a week,&rdquo; said he, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; ejaculated Ebenezer. &ldquo;That's the strangest thing I ever
      heard. How in the name of conscience can a boy earn so much money trampin'
      round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would not be worth as much to anyone else,&rdquo; said Melville,
      &ldquo;but Herbert suits me, and I need cheerful company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't goin' to keep him long at that figger, be you, Mr. Melville?&rdquo;
       asked Mr. Graham, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we shall be together a considerable time, Mr. Graham. If,
      however, you should be willing to pay Herbert a larger salary, I might
      feel it only just to release him from his engagement to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me pay more'n six dollars a week!&rdquo; gasped Ebenezer. &ldquo;I ain't quite crazy.
      Why, it would take about all I get from the post office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't expect me to take less than I can earn elsewhere, Mr.
      Graham,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o!&rdquo; answered the storekeeper, slowly. He was evidently nonplused by
      the absolute necessity of getting another clerk, and his inability to
      think of a suitable person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Tom Tripp was with me, I might work him into the business,&rdquo; said
      Ebenezer, thoughtfully, &ldquo;but he's bound out to a farmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An inspiration came to Herbert. He knew that his mother would be glad to
      earn something, and there was little else to do in Wayneboro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you might make an arrangement with my mother, to make
      up and sort the mail, for a time, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so I could; I didn't think of that,&rdquo; answered Ebenezer, relieved.
      &ldquo;Do you think she'd come over to-morrow mornin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she can't, I will,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I don't meet Mr. Melville till nine
      o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do! I'll expect you. I guess I'll come over and see your mother this
      evenin', and see if I can't come to some arrangement with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be added that Mr. Graham did as proposed, and Mrs. Carr agreed to
      render him the assistance he needed for three dollars a week. It required
      only her mornings, and a couple of hours at the close of the afternoon,
      and she was very glad to convert so much time into money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me feel more independent,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don't want to feel that
      you do all the work, Herbert, and maintain the family single-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same evening Herbert broached the plan of traveling with Mr. Melville.
      As might have been expected, his mother was at first startled, and
      disposed to object, but Herbert set before her the advantages, both to
      himself and the family, and touched upon the young man's need of a
      companion so skillfully and eloquently that she was at last brought to
      regard the proposal favorably. She felt that George Melville was one to
      whom she could safely trust her only boy. Moreover, her own time would be
      partly occupied, owing to the arrangement she had just made to assist in
      the post office, so that Herbert carried his point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenth of October arrived, the date which George Melville had fixed
      upon for his departure. Mrs. Carr had put Herbert's wardrobe in order, and
      he had bought himself a capacious carpetbag and an umbrella, and looked
      forward with eagerness to the day on which their journey was to commence.
      He had long thought and dreamed of the West, its plains and cities, but
      had never supposed that it would be his privilege to make acquaintance
      with them, at any rate, until he should have become twice his present age.
      But the unexpected had happened, and on Monday he and George Melville were
      to start for Chicago.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE IN CHICAGO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In due time our travelers reached Chicago, and put up at the Palmer House.
      Herbert was much impressed by the elegance of the hotel, its sumptuous
      furniture, and luxurious table. It must be considered that he was an
      inexperienced traveler, though had he been otherwise he might be excused
      for his admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some business in Chicago, and shall remain two or three days,&rdquo;
       said George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was quite reconciled to the delay, and, as his services were not
      required, employed his time in making himself familiar with the famous
      Western city. He kept his eyes open, and found something new and
      interesting at every step. One day, as he was passing through the lower
      portion of the city, his attention was called to a young man wheeling a
      barrow of cabbages and other vegetables, a little in advance of him. Of
      course, there was nothing singular about this, but there seemed something
      familiar in the figure of the young man. Herbert quickened his step, and
      soon came up with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance was enough. Though disguised by a pair of overalls, and without
      a coat, Herbert recognized the once spruce dry-goods clerk, Eben Graham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben recognized Herbert at the same time. He started, and flushed with
      shame, not because of the theft of which he had been guilty, but because
      he was detected in an honest, but plebeian labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert Carr!&rdquo; he exclaimed, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Eben; it is I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find me changed,&rdquo; said Eben, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should recognize you anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean that. I have sunk very low,&rdquo; and he glanced pathetically at
      the wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you refer to your employment, I don't agree with you. It is an honest
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but I never dreamed when I stood behind the counter in Boston, and
      waited on fashionable ladies, that I should ever come to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems more ashamed of wheeling vegetables than of stealing,&rdquo; thought
      Herbert, and he was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you happen to be in this business, Eben?&rdquo; he asked, with some
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must do it or starve. I was cheated out of my money soon after I came
      here, and didn't know where to turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben did not explain that he lost his money in a gambling house. He might
      have been cheated out of it, but it was his own fault, for venturing into
      competition with older and more experienced knaves than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went for thirty-six hours without food,&rdquo; continued Eben, &ldquo;when I fell
      in with a man who kept a vegetable store, and he offered to employ me. I
      have been with him ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were fortunate to find employment,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunate!&rdquo; repeated Eben, in a tragic tone. &ldquo;How much wages do you think
      I get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five dollars a week, and have to find myself,&rdquo; answered Eben, mournfully.
      &ldquo;What would my fashionable friends in Boston say if they could see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't mind what they said as long as you are getting an honest
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you happen to be out here?&rdquo; asked Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      His story was told in a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always in luck!&rdquo; said Eben, enviously. &ldquo;I wish I had your chance.
      Is Mr. Melville very rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is rich; but I don't know how rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he'd lend me money enough to get home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ask him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him that you made the request, Eben,&rdquo; answered Herbert,
      cautiously. &ldquo;Have you applied to your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the old man? Yes. He hasn't any more heart than a grindstone,&rdquo; said
      Eben, bitterly. &ldquo;What do you think he wrote me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refused, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is his letter,&rdquo; said Eben, drawing from his pocket a greasy half
      sheet of note paper. &ldquo;See what he has to say to his only son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EBEN GRAHAM: I have received your letter, and am not surprised to hear
      that you are in trouble. 'As a man sows, so also shall he reap.' A young
      man who will rob his father of his hard earnings is capable of anything.
      You have done what you could to ruin me, and deserve what you have got.
      You want me to send you money to come home, and continue your wicked work&mdash;I
      shall not do it. I wash my hands of you; I have already given notice,
      through the country paper that I have given you your time, and shall pay
      no more debts of your contracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear that you are engaged in an honest employment. It is
      better than I expected. I would not have been surprised if I had heard
      that you were in jail. My advice to you is to stay where you are and make
      yourself useful to your employer. He may in time raise your wages. Five
      years hence, if you have turned over a new leaf and led an honest life, I
      may give you a place in my store. At present, I would rather leave you
      where you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EBENEZER GRAHAM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to that? Isn't that rather rough on an only son, eh?&rdquo;
       said Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Herbert that Eben hardly deserved very liberal treatment
      from his father, notwithstanding he was an only son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the old man is awfully mean and close-fisted,&rdquo; said Eben. &ldquo;He cares
      more for money than for anything else. By the way, how does Melville treat
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, emphasizing the Mr., &ldquo;is always kind and
      considerate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pays you well, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pays me more than I could get anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pays all your hotel and traveling expenses, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a good salary besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; said Eben, suddenly, &ldquo;I want you to do me a favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've always known me, you know. When you was a little chap, and came
      into the store, I used to give you sticks of candy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't remember it,&rdquo; answered Herbert, truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, all the same. You were so young that you don't remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Eben, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to lend me ten dollars, Herbert, in memory of old times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was generously inclined, on ordinary occasions, but did not feel
      so on this occasion. He felt that Eben was not a deserving object, even
      had he felt able to make so large a loan. Besides, he could not forget
      that the young man who now asked a favor had brought a false charge of
      stealing against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to excuse me, Eben,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;To begin with, I cannot
      afford to lend so large a sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would pay you back as soon as I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;though I have not much confidence in
      it. But you seem to forget that you charged me with stealing only a short
      time since. I wonder how you have the face to ask me to lend you ten
      dollars, or any sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; muttered Eben, showing some signs of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I won't say anything more about it while you are in trouble.
      But you must excuse my declining to lend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me five dollars, then,&rdquo; pleaded Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To buy lottery tickets. I am almost sure I should win a prize, and then I
      can pay you five dollars for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't lend any money for that purpose to my dearest friend,&rdquo; said
      Herbert &ldquo;Buying lottery tickets is about the most foolish investment you
      could make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't buy any,&rdquo; said Eben. &ldquo;Lend me the money and I will use it to
      buy clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to excuse me,&rdquo; said Herbert, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think you'd be so mean,&rdquo; whined Eben, &ldquo;to a friend in distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't look upon you as a friend, and for very good reasons,&rdquo; retorted
      Herbert, as he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben looked after him with a scowl of hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to humble that boy's pride,&rdquo; he muttered, as he slowly resumed
      his march.

      CHAPTER XXI. COL. WARNER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Herbert returned to the hotel he found George Melville in the reading
      room in conversation with a tall and dignified-looking stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your brother, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; asked the latter, as Herbert came
      forward and spoke to Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Colonel, he is my young friend and confidential clerk, Herbert Carr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Carr,&rdquo; said the colonel, affably,
      extending his hand as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Col. Warner, Herbert,&rdquo; explained George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, who was naturally polite, shook hands with the colonel, and said
      he was glad to make his acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been talking with Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;I am sorry to
      hear that he is traveling in search of health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I hope he will find his journey beneficial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not a doubt of it! Not a doubt of it! I've been there myself. Do you
      know, when I was twenty-five, which I take to be about the age of your
      employer, I thought I should die of consumption?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have supposed it, sir,&rdquo; said Herbert, and Melville, too, felt
      surprised, as he noticed the stalwart proportions of the former
      consumptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! I dare say not,&rdquo; said the colonel, laughing. &ldquo;I don't look much
      like it now, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you certainly don't, colonel,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;I am curious to know
      how you overcame the threatened danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did what you are doing, sir; I came West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the mere coming West did not cure you, did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it was the life I lived,&rdquo; returned Col. \Varner. &ldquo;I didn't stay
      in the cities; I went into the wilderness. I lived in a log-cabin. I
      bought a horse, and rode every day. I kept in the open air, and, after a
      while, I found my strength returning and my chest expanding, and in a
      twelvemonth I could afford to laugh at doctors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have never had a return of the old symptoms?&rdquo; asked Melville,
      with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, except four years afterwards, when I went to New York and remained
      nearly a year. I am now fifty, and rather hale and hearty for my years,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me advise you to follow my example, Mr. Melville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my intention when I started West to live very much as you
      indicated,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;Now that I have heard your experience, I am
      confirmed in my resolve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I am glad to hear it. When do you leave Chicago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how far West do you intend to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of Colorado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't do better. I know Colorado like a book. In fact, I own some
      valuable mining property there, up in&mdash;ahem! Gilpin County. By the
      way&mdash;I take it you are a rich man&mdash;why don't you invest in that
      way? Perhaps, however, you have it in view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't thought of it,&rdquo; answered Melville. &ldquo;The fact is, I am not
      anxious to become richer, having enough for all my present needs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;But you might marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if I did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have money enough,&rdquo; said Col. Warner, finishing the sentence
      for him. &ldquo;Well, I am delighted to hear it. I am very well fixed myself&mdash;in
      fact, some of my friends call me, ha! ha!&mdash;the nabob. But, as I was
      saying I am rich enough and to spare, and still&mdash;you may be surprised&mdash;still
      I have no objection to making a little more money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner nodded his head vigorously, and watched George Melville to see
      the effect upon him of this extraordinary statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very natural, colonel,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;I believe most people want to be
      richer. Perhaps if I had vigorous health I might have the same wish. At
      present my chief wish is to recover my health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do it, sir, you'll do it&mdash;and in short order, too! Then you
      can turn your attention to money-making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Melville, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not for yourself, for your young friend here,&rdquo; added the colonel. &ldquo;I
      take it he is not rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my fortune still to make, Col. Warner,&rdquo; said Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The easiest thing in the world out here, my boy!&rdquo; said the colonel,
      paternally. &ldquo;So you start to-morrow?&rdquo; he inquired, turning to Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad! I've a great mind to accompany you,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;Why
      shouldn't I? I've got through all my business in Chicago, and I like the
      pure air of the prairies best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be glad of your company, colonel,&rdquo; said Melville, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir; that decides me. I'll see you again and fix the hour of
      going, or rather I'll conform myself to your arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of my new acquaintance, Col. Warner, Herbert?&rdquo; asked
      Melville when they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have a very good opinion of himself,&rdquo; answered Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is very well pleased with himself. He isn't a man exactly to my
      taste, but he seems a representative Western man. He does not look much
      like a consumptive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel an interest in him on that account,&rdquo; said Melville, seriously. &ldquo;If
      at any time I could become as strong and stalwart I would willingly
      surrender one-half, nay nine-tenths of my fortune. Ill health is a great
      drag upon a man; it largely curtails his enjoyments, and deprives him of
      all ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why his remedy wouldn't work well in your case, Mr.
      Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it may. At any rate, I feel inclined to try it. I am glad the
      colonel is going to travel with us, as I shall be able to question him
      about the details of his cure. He seems a bluff, genial fellow, and though
      I don't expect to enjoy his companionship much, I hope to derive some
      benefit from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Melville, I met an old acquaintance while I was out
      walking,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben Graham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he look&mdash;prosperous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly&mdash;he was wheeling a barrow of vegetables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he wanted to borrow money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised at that; I thought it time for him to be out of money.
      Did you lend him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I found he wanted money to buy a lottery ticket. I told him I
      wouldn't lend money to my best friend for that purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sensible in you, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had been in distress, I might have let him have a few dollars,
      notwithstanding he treated me so meanly at Wayneboro, but he seems to be
      earning a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume he doesn't enjoy the business he is in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he complains that he has lowered himself by accepting such a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't occur to him that he lowered himself when he stole money from
      his father, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't seem to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day Herbert came across Col. Warner in the corridor of the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! my young friend!&rdquo; he said, affably. &ldquo;I am glad to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No change since morning,&rdquo; answered Herbert, slightly smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Herbert&mdash;your name is Herbert, isn't it&mdash;may I
      offer you a cigar?&rdquo; said Col. Warner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel opened his cigar-case and extended it to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, but I don't smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't smoke? That is, you don't smoke cigars. May I offer you a
      cigarette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't smoke at all, colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, remarkable! Why, sir, before I was your age I smoked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it good for consumption?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, you have me there! Well, perhaps not. Do you know,&rdquo; said the
      colonel, changing the conversation, &ldquo;I feel a great interest in your
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Upon my soul, I do. He is a most interesting young man. Rich, too! I am
      glad he is rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would value health more than money,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, to be sure! By the way, you don't know how much property your
      friend has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, he never told me,&rdquo; answered Herbert, surprised at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keeps such matters close, eh? Now, I don't. I never hesitate to own up to
      a quarter of a million. Yes, quarter of a million! That's the size of my
      pile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fortunate, Col. Warner,&rdquo; said Herbert, sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am, so I am! Two years hence I shall have half a million, if all
      goes well. So you won't have a cigar; no? Well, I'll see you later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a strange man,&rdquo; thought Herbert. &ldquo;I wonder if his statements can be
      relied upon.&rdquo; Somehow Herbert doubted it. He was beginning to distrust the
      colonel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. A MOUNTAIN STAGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We pass over several days, and change the scene. We left Herbert and
      Melville in the Palmer House in Chicago, surrounded by stately edifices
      and surging crowds. Now everything is changed. They are in a mountainous
      district, where a man might ride twenty miles without seeing a house. They
      are, in fact, within the limits of what was then known as the Territory of
      Colorado. It is not generally known that Colorado contains over a hundred
      mountain summits over ten thousand feet above the sea level. It is perhaps
      on account of the general elevation that it is recommended by physicians
      as a good health resort for all who are troubled with lung complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of which I speak most of the traveling was done by stage. Now
      railroads unite the different portions with links of steel, and make
      traveling less cumbersome and laborious. There was one of the party,
      however, who did not complain, but rather enjoyed the jolting of the
      lumbering stage-coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner was of the party. He professed to feel an extraordinary
      interest in George Melville, and was anxious to show him the country where
      he had himself regained his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonely, sir!&rdquo; repeated the colonel, in answer to a remark of George
      Melville. &ldquo;Why, sir, it's a populous city compared with what it was in
      '55, when I was out here. I built myself a cabin in the woods, and once
      for twelve months I didn't see a white face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there many Indians, Colonel?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indians? I should say so. Only twenty miles from my cabin was an Indian
      village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they trouble you any?&rdquo; asked Herbert, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they tried to,&rdquo; answered the colonel. &ldquo;One night as I lay awake I
      heard stealthy steps outside, and peeping through a crevice between the
      logs just above the head of my bed&mdash;by the way, my bed was the skin
      of a bear I had myself killed&mdash;I could see a string of Utes preparing
      to besiege me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you afraid?&rdquo; asked Herbert, a little mischievously, for he knew
      pretty well what the colonel would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; repeated the colonel, indignantly. &ldquo;What do you take me for? I
      have plenty of faults,&rdquo; continued Col. Warner, modestly, &ldquo;but cowardice
      isn't one of them. No, sir; I never yet saw the human being, white, black,
      or red, that I stood in fear of. But, as I was saying, the redskins
      collected around my cabin, and were preparing to break in the door, when I
      leveled my revolver and brought down their foremost man. This threw them
      into confusion. They retreated a little way, then advanced again with a
      horrible yell, and I gave myself up for lost. But I got in another shot,
      bringing down another warrior, this time the son of their chief. The same
      scene was repeated. Well, to make a long story short, I repulsed them at
      every advance, and finally when but three were left, they concluded that
      prudence was the better part of valor, and fled, leaving their dead and
      wounded behind them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many were there of them?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the morning when I went out I found seven dead redskins, and two
      others lying at the point of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was certainly a thrilling adventure, Colonel,&rdquo; said George Melville,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, I should say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I don't care to meet with any such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no danger, no danger!&rdquo; said the colonel, airily. &ldquo;That is,
      comparatively speaking. In fact, the chief danger is of a different sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the sleigh upsetting and tipping us out into some of the canyons, I
      suppose you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I speak of the gentlemen of the road&mdash;road agents as they are
      generally called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean highwaymen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much danger of meeting them?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's a chance. They are quite in the habit of attacking
      stage-coaches, and plundering the passengers. Sometimes they make rich
      hauls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be rather inconvenient to the passengers.&rdquo; said Melville.
      &ldquo;Can't the laws reach these outlaws?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't seem to. Why, there are men who have been in the business for
      years, and have never been caught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said a fellow traveler. &ldquo;There's Jerry Lane, for instance. He
      has succeeded thus far in eluding the vigilance of the authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;I once saw Lane myself. Indeed he did me the
      honor of relieving me of five hundred dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you help it?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he covered me with his revolver, and if I had drawn mine I shouldn't
      have lived to take aim at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in a stage at the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was riding on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Lane a large man?&rdquo; asked George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not larger than myself,&rdquo; continued the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he live&mdash;in some secret haunt in the forest, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, he doesn't confine himself to one place. He travels a good deal.
      Sometimes he goes to St. Louis. I have heard that he sometimes even visits
      New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is he not recognized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he looks like anything but an outlaw. If you should see him you might
      think him a prosperous merchant, or banker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's curious!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;when you travel by stage-coaches in
      these solitudes you have to take the chances. Now I carry my money
      concealed in an inner pocket, where it isn't very likely to be found. Of
      course I have another wallet, just for show, and I give that up when I
      have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a stout, florid gentleman present, who listened to the above
      conversation with ill-disguised nervousness. He was a New York capitalist,
      of German birth, going out to inspect a mine in which he proposed
      purchasing an interest. His name was Conrad Stiefel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had no idea a man ran such a risk, or I would
      have stayed at home. I decidedly object to being robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are robbed in a different way in New York,&rdquo; said George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean, Mr. Melville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By defaulting clerks, absconding cashiers, swindlers of excellent social
      position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we don't mind those things,&rdquo; said Mr. Stiefel. &ldquo;We can look out for
      ourselves. But when a man points at you with a revolver, that is
      terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, my dear sir, you take good care of your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I do,&rdquo; said Stiefel, complacently. &ldquo;I carry it in a belt around my
      waist. That's a good place, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I commend your prudence, sir,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;You are evidently a
      wise and judicious man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't think of looking there, hey?&rdquo; laughed Stiefel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think what you like, Mr. Stiefel,&rdquo; said a tall, thin passenger,
      who looked like a book peddler, &ldquo;but I contend that my money is in a safer
      place than yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Parker, I should like to know where you keep it,&rdquo; said Col.
      Warner, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't get at it without taking off my stockings,&rdquo; said the tall man,
      looking about him in a self-satisfied manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, 'pon my soul!&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;I really don't know but I
      shall adopt your hiding place. I am an old traveler, but not too old to
      adopt new ideas when I meet with good ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you would find it to your interest, Colonel,&rdquo; said Parker,
      looking flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the colonel, genially, &ldquo;suppose we change the subject.
      There isn't much chance of our being called upon to produce our money, or
      part with it. Still, as I said a while since, it's best to be cautious,
      and I see that you all are so. I begin to feel hungry, gentlemen. How is
      it with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we anywhere near the place for supper?&rdquo; asked Stiefel. &ldquo;I wish I
      could step into a good Broadway restaurant; I feel empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a mile hence, gentlemen, we shall reach Echo Gulch, where we halt
      for the night. There's a rude cabin there, where they will provide us with
      supper and shelter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This announcement gave general satisfaction. The colonel proved to be
      right. The stage soon drew up in front of a long one-story building, which
      bore the pretentious name of the Echo Gulch Hotel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. A STARTLING REVELATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A stout, black-bearded man stood in front of the hotel to welcome the
      stage passengers. He took a clay pipe from his lips and nodded a welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you, strangers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here, Peter, you black rascal,
      help the gentlemen with their baggage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was thrown open, and the party filed into a comfortless looking
      apartment, at one end of which was a rude bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the passengers, at least, seemed to know the landlord, for Col.
      Warner advanced to greet him, his face beaming with cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, John?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How does the world use you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord growled something inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a drink, colonel?&rdquo; was the first audible remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't care if I do. It's confounded dry traveling over these mountain
      roads. Walk up, gentlemen. Col. Warner doesn't drink alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of Herbert and George Melville, the passengers seemed
      inclined to accept the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Melville,&rdquo; said the colonel; &ldquo;you and your friend must join
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please excuse me, colonel,&rdquo; answered Melville. &ldquo;I would prefer not to
      drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense! To oblige me, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; but I am traveling for my health, and it would not be
      prudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you say, Melville; but a little whisky would warm you up and do
      you good, in my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you all the same, colonel; but I think you must count me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel shrugged his shoulders and beckoned Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can come, anyway; your health won't prevent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melville did not interfere, for he knew it would give offense, but he
      hoped his young clerk would refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Herbert; &ldquo;I won't object to a glass of sarsaparilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarsaparilla!&rdquo; repeated the colonel, in amazement. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't keep no medicine,&rdquo; growled the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you root-beer?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo; said the landlord, contemptuously. &ldquo;I haven't
      got no root-beer. Whisky's good enough for any man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you'll excuse me, then,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I am not used to any
      strong drinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; asked the colonel, rather contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen years old and don't drink whisky! My young friend, your education
      has been sadly neglected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it has,&rdquo; answered Herbert, good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Col. Warner, apologetically, &ldquo;the boy is a stranger, and
      isn't used to our free Western ways. He's got the makings of a man in him,
      and it won't be long before he'll get over his squeamishness, and walk up
      to the bar as quick as any one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Melville stood apart, while the rest of the company emptied
      their glasses, apparently at a gulp. It was clear that their refusal had
      caused them to be regarded with dislike and suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accommodations of the Echo Gulch Hotel were far from luxurious. The
      chambers were scarcely larger than a small closet, clap-boarded but not
      plastered, and merely contained a bedstead. Washing accommodations were
      provided downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and George Melville were assigned to a single room, to which they
      would not have objected had the room been larger. It was of no use to
      indulge in open complaints, however, since others had to fare in the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't luxury, Herbert,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the boy; &ldquo;but I don't mind it if you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I may keep you awake by my coughing, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I once get to sleep. I sleep as sound as a top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I did; but I am one of the wakeful kind. Being an invalid, I am
      more easily annoyed by small inconveniences. You, with your sturdy health,
      are more easily suited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Melville, I had just as lief sleep downstairs in a chair, and give
      you the whole of the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on my account, Herbert. I congratulate myself on having you for a
      roommate. If I had been traveling alone I might have been packed away with
      the colonel, who, by this time, would be even less desirable as a
      bedfellow than usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy colonel had not been content with a single glass of whisky, but
      had followed it up several times, till his utterance had become thick, and
      his face glowed with a dull, brick-dust color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner had been assigned to the adjoining chamber, or closet,
      whichever it may be called. He did not retire early, however, while
      Herbert and George Melville did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, Herbert, who was usually so good a sleeper, after a
      short nap woke up. He turned to look at his companion, for it was a
      moonlight night, and saw that he was sleeping quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what's got into me?&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I thought I should sleep till
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to compose himself to sleep, but the more effort he made the
      broader awake he became. Sometimes it seems as if such unaccountable
      deviations from our ordinary habits were Heaven-sent. As Herbert lay awake
      he suddenly became aware of a conversation which was being carried on, in
      low tones, in the next room. The first voice he heard, he recognized as
      that of the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;some of the passengers have got money. There's that
      Stiefel probably carries a big sum in gold and notes. When I was speaking
      of the chance of the stage being robbed, he was uncommon nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's Stiefel?&rdquo; was growled in another voice, which Herbert had no
      difficulty in recognizing as the landlord's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's the fat, red-faced German. From his talk, I reckon he's come out
      to buy mines somewhere in Colorado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll save him the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we will&mdash;good joke, John. Oh, about this Stiefel, he carries his
      money in a belt round his waist. I infer that it is gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! What about the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a tall, thin man&mdash;his name is Parker,&rdquo; proceeded the
      colonel; &ldquo;he's smart, or thinks he is; you'll have to pull his stockings
      off to get his money. Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find out, colonel?&rdquo; asked the landlord, in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drew it out of him, sir. He didn't know who he was confiding in. He'll
      wonder how the deuce his hiding place was suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Other passengers were referred to who have not been mentioned, and in each
      case the colonel was able to tell precisely where their money was kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about that milksop that wouldn't drink with us?&rdquo; inquired the
      landlord, after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melville? I couldn't find out where he keeps his cash. Probably he keeps
      it in his pocket. He doesn't look like a cautious man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a clerk or secretary of Melville's. He hasn't any money, and isn't
      worth attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very glad to hear it,&rdquo; thought Herbert. &ldquo;I don't care to receive any
      attention from such gentry. But who would have thought the colonel was in
      league with stage robbers? I thought him a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert began to understand why it was that Col. Warner, if that was his
      real name, had drawn the conversation to stage robbers, and artfully
      managed to discover where each of the passengers kept his supply of money.
      It was clear that he was in league with the landlord of the Echo Gulch
      Hotel, who, it was altogether probable, intended to waylay the stage the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a serious condition of affairs. The time had been when, in
      reading stories of adventure, Herbert had wished that he, too, might have
      some experience of the kind. Now that the opportunity had come, our hero
      was disposed to regard the matter with different eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be done,&rdquo; he asked himself, anxiously, &ldquo;to escape the danger
      which threatens us to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. A MORNING WALK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Herbert found it difficult to sleep from anxiety. He felt that the burden
      was too great for him alone to bear, and he desired to speak on the
      subject to George Melville. But there was a difficulty about doing this
      undetected, on account of the thinness of the partitions between the
      rooms. If he could hear Col. Warner, the latter would also be able to hear
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage was to start at seven o'clock the next morning, and before that
      time some decision must be made. The first question was, should they, or
      should they not, take passage, as they had anticipated?
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five, Herbert, turning in bed, found his bedfellow awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Melville,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I have something important to communicate,
      and cannot do so here on account of the danger of being heard in the next
      room. Are you willing to dress and take a little walk with me before
      breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Melville's physical condition did not make him usually favorable to
      early rising, but he knew Herbert well enough to understand that he had a
      satisfactory reason for his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Herbert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word was exchanged, for Mr. Melville's discretion prevailed over his
      curiosity. In ten minutes both were fully dressed and descended the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one stirring except a woman, the landlord's wife, who was
      lighting the fire in order to prepare breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded the two with surprise, and perhaps a little distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're stirrin' early, strangers,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Melville, courteously, &ldquo;we are going to take a little walk
      before breakfast; it may sharpen our appetites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;that's curious. I wouldn't get up so early if I
      wasn't obliged. There ain't much to see outdoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a new part of the country to us,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;and we may not
      have another chance to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will breakfast be ready?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour, more or less,&rdquo; answered the woman, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will be back in time,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady evidently thought their early-rising a singular proceeding,
      but her suspicions were not aroused. She resumed her work, and Herbert and
      his friend walked out through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had reached a spot a dozen rods or more distant, Melville turned
      to his young clerk and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Herbert, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have discovered, Mr. Melville, that our stage is to be stopped to-day
      and the passengers plundered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you discover this?&rdquo; asked Melville, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a conversation which I overheard in the next chamber to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that chamber is occupied by Col. Warner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is one of the conspirators,&rdquo; said Herbert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; ejaculated Melville. &ldquo;Can we have been so deceived in
      him? Does he propose to waylay the stage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I presume he will be one of the passengers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all you know about this matter, Herbert. Who is engaged with him
      in this plot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The landlord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not much surprised at this,&rdquo; said Melville, thoughtfully. &ldquo;He is an
      ill-looking man, whose appearance fits the part of highwayman very well.
      Then you think the colonel is in league with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of that. Don't you remember how skillfully Col. Warner drew out
      of the passengers the hiding places of their money yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told all to the landlord, and he will no doubt make use of the
      knowledge. That is all, Mr. Melville. I could not rest till I had told
      you, so that you might decide what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems quite providential that you were kept awake last night, Herbert,
      otherwise this blow would have come upon us unprepared. Even with the
      knowledge that it impends, I hardly know what it is best for us to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might decide not to go in the stage,&rdquo; suggested Hebert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we should have to go to-morrow. We cannot stay here, and there is no
      other way of traveling. As the colonel seems to think I have money, there
      would be another attack to-morrow. Besides, where could we stay except at
      this hotel, which is kept, as it appears, by the principal robber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Herbert, puzzled; &ldquo;I didn't think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would quite as soon stand my chance of being robbed in the stage, as be
      attacked here. Besides, I cannot make up my mind to desert my fellow
      passengers. It seems cowardly to send them off to be plundered without
      giving them a hint of their danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't we do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The result would be that they would not go, and there is no knowing how
      long we should be compelled to remain in this secluded spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, suddenly, &ldquo;a thought has just struck me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it may show us a way out of our danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sorry to say that it won't do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Herbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember that mention was made yesterday in the stage of a certain
      famous bandit named Jerry Lane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it is possible that he and Col. Warner may be one and the
      same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is certainly a startling suggestion, Herbert. What reason have you
      for thinking so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only a guess on my part; but you remember that the colonel said he
      was a man about his size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he did not confine himself to the Western country, but might be met
      with in New York, or St. Louis. We met the colonel in Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be as you surmise, Herbert,&rdquo; said George Melville, after a pause.
      &ldquo;It did occur to me that our worthy landlord might be the famous outlaw in
      question, but the description to which you refer seems to fit the colonel
      better. There is one thing, however, that makes me a little incredulous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, Mr. Melville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Jerry Lane I take to be cool and courageous, while the colonel
      appears to be more of a boaster. He looks like one who can talk better
      than he can act. If I had ever seen a description of his appearance, I
      could judge better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two had been walking slowly and thoughtfully, when they were startled
      by a rough voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're out early, strangers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning swiftly, they saw the dark, forbidding face of the landlord, who
      had approached them unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he hear anything?&rdquo; thought Herbert, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are taking a little walk,&rdquo; said Melville, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast will be ready soon. You'd better be back soon, if you're goin'
      by the stage this morning. You are goin', I reckon?&rdquo; said the landlord,
      eyeing them sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We intend to do so,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;We will walk a little farther, and
      then return to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord turned and retraced his steps to the Echo Gulch Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he heard anything that we were saying?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what brought him out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he wanted to make sure that we were going in the stage. He is
      laudably anxious to have as many victims and as much plunder as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him you were going in the stage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have decided to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you decided upon anything else, Mr. Melville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not positively; but there will be time to think of that. Did you hear
      where we were to be attacked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a point about five miles from here,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      This he had gathered from the conversation he had overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two friends reached the hotel, they found Col. Warner already
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, gentlemen!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So you have taken a walk? I never
      walk before breakfast, for my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I often,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;In this case I was persuaded by my young
      friend. I am repaid by a good appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I persuade you to try a glass of bitters, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; asked the
      colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, colonel. You will have to excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast's ready!&rdquo; announced the landlady, and the stage passengers sat
      down at a long, unpainted, wooden table, where the food was of the
      plainest. In spite of the impending peril of which they, only, had
      knowledge, Herbert ate heartily, but Melville seemed preoccupied.

      CHAPTER XXV. MELVILLE MAKES A SENSATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Col. Warner seemed in very good spirits. He ate and drank with violent
      enjoyment, and was as affable as usual. George Melville regarded him with
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man does not appear like a desperado or outlaw,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;There
      is nothing to distinguish him from the majority of men one meets in
      ordinary intercourse. He is a problem to me, I should like to study him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner did not fail to observe the unconscious intentness with which
      Melville regarded him, and, for some reason, it did not please him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lost your appetite, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; he said, lightly. &ldquo;You have
      been looking at me until&mdash;egad!&mdash;if I were a vain man, I should
      conclude there was something striking about my appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't gainsay that, Colonel,&rdquo; answered Melville, adroitly. &ldquo;I confess I
      am not very hungry, and I will further confess that I have something on my
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Better make me your father confessor,&rdquo; said the colonel, whose
      suspicion or annoyance was removed by this ready reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I may, after a while,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the hint, and ceased to regard the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter made himself generally social, and generally popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage drove round to the door after breakfast, and there was the usual
      bustle, as the passengers bestowed themselves inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Melville had intended to watch narrowly the landlord and Col.
      Warner, to detect, if possible, the secret understanding which must exist
      between them. But he was deprived of an opportunity, for the very good
      reason that the landlord had disappeared, and was not again seen before
      their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver gathered up his reins, cracked his whip, and the stage started.
      Herbert looked at George Melville a little anxiously, not knowing what
      course he had decided to take. They two, it will be remembered, were the
      only ones who knew of the intended attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the stage started, Melville quietly took the opportunity to hand
      his pocketbook to Herbert, saying, briefly: &ldquo;It will be safer with you in
      case of an attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But won't it be considered suspicious that you have no money about you?&rdquo;
       suggested Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a roll of bills in my pocket-fifty dollars,&rdquo; answered Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no further opportunity of speaking, as one of the passengers came
      up where they were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had already taken his seat in the coach, when his employer said:
      &ldquo;Herbert, wouldn't you like to ride outside with the driver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Herbert, promptly, for he understood, that this was
      Mr. Melville's wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will give us more room, and you will have a better view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I shall like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a quick manner Herbert made the change, taking care not to look
      significantly at Melville, as some boys might have done, and thus excited
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first mile there was very little conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Col. Warner spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are fairly on our way. Let us hope nothing
      will mar our pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you anticipate anything?&rdquo; asked George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! Why should I? We have a skillful driver, and I guarantee he won't tip
      us over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Melville was, perhaps, referring to the chance of the stage being
      stopped by some enterprising road agent,&rdquo; suggested Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! Sits the wind in that quarter?&rdquo; said the Colonel, laughing lightly.
      &ldquo;Not the least chance of that&mdash;that is, the chance is very slight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke differently yesterday,&rdquo; said the German capitalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? I didn't mean it, I assure you. We are as safe here as if we were
      riding in the interior of New York. I suppose I was only whiling away a
      few idle minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the German. &ldquo;I shouldn't like to meet any of
      these gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; answered Melville; &ldquo;but I am prepared to give him or them a warm
      reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he drew a revolver from his pocket. He sat next to the door,
      and in an exposed situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put up your shooting iron, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Col. Warner, exhibiting a
      slight shade of annoyance. &ldquo;Let me exchange places with you. I should
      prefer the post of danger, if' there is any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Colonel,&rdquo; said Melville, quietly, &ldquo;but I don't care to
      change. I am quite satisfied with my seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir, I insist&mdash;&rdquo; said the Colonel, making a motion to
      rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your seat, Colonel! I insist upon staying where I am,&rdquo; answered
      Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was physically far from formidable, this young man, but there was a
      resolute ring in his voice that showed he was in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the Colonel, trying to conceal his annoyance,
      &ldquo;you have been quite misled by my foolish talk. I did not suppose you were
      so nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly I may have a special reason for being so,&rdquo; returned George
      Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the Colonel, quickly. &ldquo;If you have, we are
      all interested, and ought to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonel is right,&rdquo; said the German. &ldquo;If you know of any danger, it is
      only fair to inform us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am disposed to agree with you, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;Briefly,
      then, I have good reason to think that this company of passengers has been
      marked for plunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner started, but, quickly recovering himself, he laughed uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I put no faith in it. Some one has been deceiving you,
      my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the other passengers took it more seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You evidently know something that we do not,&rdquo; said Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner looked at him searchingly, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was the time to test George Melville's nerve. He was about to take a
      bold step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I regret to say that I have every reason to believe
      there is a man in this stage who is in league with the road agents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This statement naturally made a sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were seven passengers, and each regarded the rest with new-born
      suspicion. There seemed, on the whole, about as much reason to suspect one
      man as another, and each, with the exception of Melville, found himself
      looked upon with distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, Melville! You must have had bad dreams!&rdquo; said Col. Warner, who was
      the first to recover his self-possession. &ldquo;Really, I give you credit for a
      first-class sensation. As for you, gentlemen, you may take stock in this
      cock-and-bull story, if you like; I shall not. I, for one, have no fear of
      my fellow passengers. I regard them all as gentlemen, and shall not allow
      myself to be disturbed by any silly fears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The air of calm composure with which the Colonel spoke served to
      tranquilize the rest of the passengers, who wished to put credit in his
      assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonel speaks sensibly,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker, &ldquo;and unless Mr. Melville
      assigns a reason for his remarkable belief, I am disposed to think we have
      taken alarm too quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course; all sensible men will think so,&rdquo; said the Colonel.
      &ldquo;My friend, we shall be tempted to laugh at you if you insist on
      entertaining us with such hobgoblin fancies. My advice is, to put up that
      weapon of yours, and turn your attention to the scenery, which I can
      assure you, gentlemen, is well worthy of your admiration. Just observe the
      walls of yonder canyon, and the trees growing on the points.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;I should be glad to take the view of the last
      speaker, if I had not positive proof that he is the man who has agreed to
      deliver us into the hands of a road agent within the space of half an I
      hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you shall answer for this!&rdquo; exclaimed the Colonel, furiously, as he
      struggled to secure the weapon, his face livid with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two passengers, one the German, who, though short, was very powerful,
      forcibly prevented him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. A COUNCIL OF WAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of what you say?&rdquo; asked a passenger, turning with a puzzled
      look from George Melville, who, in the midst of the general excitement
      produced by his revelation, sat, not unmoved indeed, but comparatively
      calm. Courage and physical strength are by no means inseparable, and this
      frail young man, whose strength probably was not equal to Herbert's, was
      fearless in the face of peril which would daunt many a stalwart
      six-footer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to this very natural question, George Melville repeated the
      essential parts of the conversation which had taken place between Col.
      Warner and the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner's countenance changed, and he inwardly execrated the
      imprudence that had made his secret plan known to one of the intended
      victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true, Col. Warner?&rdquo; asked Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's a lie!&rdquo; returned the colonel, with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; said George Melville, calmly, &ldquo;you can choose which you will
      believe. I will only suggest that this man managed very adroitly to find
      out where each one of us kept his money. You can also consider whether I
      have any cause to invent this story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that the passengers were inclined to put faith in Melville's
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; said the Colonel, angrily, &ldquo;I never was so insulted in my
      life. I am a man of wealth, traveling on business; I am worth a quarter of
      a million at least. To associate me with road agents, whom I have as much
      reason to fear as you, is most ridiculous. This young man may be
      well-meaning, but he is under a most extraordinary hallucination. It is my
      belief that he dreamed the nonsense he has been retailing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the driver to stop the stage,&rdquo; said Mr. Benson, a gentleman from
      Philadelphia. &ldquo;If Mr. Melville's story is trustworthy, we may at any time
      reach the spot where the highwayman is lurking. We must have a general
      consultation, and decide what is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposal was approved, and the driver drew up the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't propose to remain in the company of men who so grossly misjudge
      me,&rdquo; said the Colonel, with dignity, as he made a motion to leave his
      fellow passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here, sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Benson, in a tone of authority. &ldquo;We cannot
      spare you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to detain me, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Warner, menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we do,&rdquo; said the German. &ldquo;Just stay where you are, Mr. Colonel, till
      we decide what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As each one of the company had produced his revolver, the Colonel thought
      it prudent to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am disgusted with this fooling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You're all a pack of
      cowards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; said George Melville, &ldquo;has this stage ever been robbed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several times,&rdquo; the driver admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was the last time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two months since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a mile further on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see this gentleman before?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the
      colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the driver, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did he last ride with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the day the stage was robbed,&rdquo; answered the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers exchanged glances, and then, as by a common impulse, all
      turned to Col. Warner, to see how he would take this damaging revelation.
      Disguise it as he might, he was clearly disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true, colonel?&rdquo; asked Benson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; answered Col. Warner, with some hesitation. &ldquo;I was robbed,
      with the rest. I had four hundred dollars in my wallet, and the road agent
      made off with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you just now pooh-poohed the idea of a robbery, and said such
      things were gone by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say so now,&rdquo; returned the colonel, sullenly. &ldquo;I have a good deal of
      money with me, but I am willing to take my chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. Your money would be returned to you, in all probability, if,
      as we have reason to believe, you have a secret understanding with the
      thieves who infest this part of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words are insulting. Let go my arm, sir, or it will be the worse for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Softly, softly, my good friend,&rdquo; said the German. &ldquo;Have you any proposal
      to make, Mr. Melville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this. Let us proceed on our journey, but let each man draw his
      revolver, and be ready to use it, if need be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must go along with us. We cannot have him communicating with our
      enemies outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I refuse, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my very good friend, I think we shall use a little force,&rdquo; said the
      German, carelessly pointing his weapon at the captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go upon compulsion,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;but I protest against this
      outrage. I am a wealthy capitalist from Chicago, who knows no more about
      road agents than you do. You have been deceived by this unsophisticated
      young man, who knows about as much of the world as a four-year-old child.
      It's a fine mare's nest he has found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sneer did not disturb the equanimity of George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to believe the colonel were as innocent as he claims,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;but his own words, overheard last night, contradict what he is
      now saying. When we have passed the spot indicated for the attack, we will
      release him, and give him the opportunity he seeks of leaving our
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The passengers resumed their places in the stage, with the exception of
      Herbert, who again took his seat beside the driver. George Melville had
      not mentioned that it was Herbert, not himself, who had overheard the
      conversation between the colonel and the land lord, fearing to expose the
      boy to future risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner sat sullenly between the German and Benson. He was evidently
      ill at ease and his restless glances showed that he was intent upon some
      plan of escape. Of this, however, such was the vigilance of his guards,
      there did not seem much chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage kept on its way till it entered a narrow roadway, lined on one
      side by a thick growth of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melville, watching the colonel narrowly, saw that, in spite of his attempt
      at calmness, his excitement was at fever heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause was very evident, for at this point a tall figure bounded from
      the underbrush, disguised by a black half mask, through which a pair of
      black eyes blazed fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop the stage!&rdquo; he thundered to the driver, &ldquo;or I will put a bullet
      through your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver, as had been directed, instantly obeyed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. COL. WARNER CHANGES FRONT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It may seem a daring thing for one man to stop a stage full of passengers,
      and require them to surrender their money and valuables, but this has been
      done time and again in unsettled portions of the West. For the most part
      the stage passengers are taken by surprise, and the road agent is known to
      be a desperado, ready to murder in cold blood anyone who dares oppose him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present instance, however, the passengers had been warned of their
      danger and were ready to meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown&mdash;for, of course, the masked man was the landlord&mdash;saw four
      revolvers leveled at him from inside the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go that horse, my friend, or you are a dead man!&rdquo; said Conrad
      Stiefel, calmly. &ldquo;Two can play at your game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown was taken by surprise, but he was destined to be still more
      astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner protruded his head from the window, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend, you had better give up your little plan. It won't work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such language from his confederate, on whom he fully relied, wholly
      disconcerted the masked robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be blowed!&rdquo; he muttered, staring, in ludicrous perplexity, at
      his fellow conspirator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;I shall really be under the necessity
      of shooting you myself if you don't leave us alone. We are all armed and
      resolute. I think you had better defer your little scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown was not quick-witted. He did not see that his confederate was trying
      cunningly to avert suspicion from himself, and taking the only course that
      remained to him. Of course, he thought he was betrayed, and was, as a
      natural consequence, exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He released his hold on the horses, but, fixing his eyes on the colonel
      fiercely, muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I get a chance at you! I'll pay you for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idiot!&rdquo; thought Warner, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;Why can't he
      see that I am forced to do as I am doing? I must make things plain to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke a few words rapidly in Spanish, which Brown evidently understood.
      His face showed a dawning comprehension of the state of affairs, and he
      stood aside while the stage drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; asked Conrad Stiefel, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard me, sir,&rdquo; said the colonel, loftily. &ldquo;You owe your rescue from
      this ruffian to me. Now, you can understand how much you have misjudged
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conrad Stiefel was not so easily satisfied of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard what you said in Mexican, or whatever lingo it is, but I didn't
      understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Benson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, gentlemen; I am ready to explain. I told this man that if he
      ever attempted to molest me I should shoot him in his track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you speak to him in English?&rdquo; asked Stiefel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I had a suspicion that the fellow was the same I met once in
      Mexico, and I spoke to him in Spanish to make sure. As he understood, I am
      convinced I was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it, then?&rdquo; asked Benson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name, sir, is Manuel de Cordova, a well-known Mexican bandit, who
      seems to have found his way to this neighborhood. He is a reckless
      desperado, and, though I addressed him boldly, I should be very sorry to
      meet him in a dark night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explanation was very fluently spoken, but probably no one present
      believed what the colonel said, or exonerated him from the charge which
      George Melville had made against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five miles further on Col. Warner left the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am sorry to leave this pleasant company, but I
      have a mining claim in this neighborhood, and must bid you farewell. I
      trust that when you think of me hereafter, you will acquit me of the
      injurious charges which have been made against me. I take no credit to
      myself for driving away the ruffian who stopped us, but hope you won't
      forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one interfered with the colonel when he proposed to leave the stage.
      Indeed, the passengers were unanimous in accepting his departure as a
      relief. In spite of his plausible representations, he was regarded with
      general suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew the meaning of that Spanish lingo,&rdquo; said the German, Conrad
      Stiefel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can interpret it for you, Mr. Stiefel,&rdquo; said George Melville, quietly.
      &ldquo;I have some knowledge of Spanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked more than one, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said: 'You fool! Don't you see the plot has been discovered? It wasn't
      my fault. I will soon join you and explain.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This revelation made a sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he was in league with the road agent, after all?&rdquo; said Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he was. Did you for a moment doubt it?&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was staggered when I saw him order the rascal away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a shrewd villain!&rdquo; said Benson. &ldquo;I hope we shan't encounter him
      again.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. THE CONSPIRATORS IN COUNCIL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that Col. Warner's intention in leaving the stage
      was to join his fellow conspirator. There was no advantage in remaining
      longer with his fellow travelers, since the opportunity of plundering them
      had passed, and for the present was not likely to return. He had been a
      little apprehensive that they would try to detain him on suspicion, which
      would have been awkward, since they had numbers on their side, and all
      were armed. But in that unsettled country he would have been an elephant
      on their hands, and if the idea entered the minds of any one of the stage
      passengers, it was instantly dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the stage was fairly on the way, Col. Warner went to a house where he
      was known, and asked for a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news, colonel?&rdquo; asked the farmer, as he called himself. Really he was
      in league with the band of which Warner was the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the Colonel, gloomily. &ldquo;No, worse luck! There might have
      been, but for an unfortunate circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's plenty of good money in that stage coach and Brown and I meant to
      have it, but some sharp-eared rascal heard us arranging the details of the
      plan, and that spoiled it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it too late now?&rdquo; asked the farmer, eagerly. &ldquo;We can follow them, and
      overtake them yet, if you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be shot for our pains. No, thank you. They are all on the alert, and
      all have their six-shooters in readiness. No, we must postpone our plan.
      There's one of the fellows that I mean to be revenged upon yet&mdash;the
      one that ferreted out our secret plan. I must bide my time, but I shall
      keep track of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon the Colonel, well-mounted, was on his way back to the rude inn where
      he had slept the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismounting he entered without ceremony, and his eyes fell upon the
      landlord's wife, engaged in some household employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Brown?&rdquo; he asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewheres round,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has he been home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A matter of two hours. He came home awfully riled, but he wouldn't tell
      me what it was about. What's happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've met with a disappointment&mdash;that's what's the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the passengers get the better of you?&rdquo; asked the woman, for she was
      in her husband's guilty secrets, and knew quite well what manner of man
      she had married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They found out our little game,&rdquo; answered Warner, shortly, for he did not
      see any advantage in wasting words on his confederate's wife. &ldquo;Which way
      did Brown go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Brown, pointing in a particular direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Warner tied his horse to a small sapling, and walked in the direction
      indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the landlord sullenly reclining beneath a large tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're back?&rdquo; he said, surveying Warner with a lowering brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a pretty mess you've made of the job!&rdquo; said the landlord, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as much your fault&mdash;nay, more!&rdquo; said his superior, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Brown, not over cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would persist in discussing our plan last night in my room, though I
      warned you we might be overheard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were overheard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What spy listened to our talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man, Melville&mdash;the one traveling with a boy. He kept it to
      himself till the stage was well on its way, and then he blabbed the whole
      thing to all in the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he mention you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell him he lied, and shoot him on the spot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I shouldn't have survived him five minutes,&rdquo; answered the
      colonel, coolly, &ldquo;or, if I had, his companions would have lynched me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown didn't look as if he would have been inconsolable had this occurred.
      In fact, he was ambitious to succeed to the place held by the colonel, as
      chief of a desperate gang of outlaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have been dangling from a branch of a tree at this moment, had I
      followed your plan, my good friend Brown, and that would have been
      particularly uncomfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might have shot me,&rdquo; said Brown, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prevented that, and gave you timely warning. Of course it's a
      disappointment, but we shall have better luck next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I propose to keep track of Melville and the boy, and have my
      revenge upon them in time. I don't care so much about the money, but they
      have foiled me, and they must suffer for it. Meanwhile, I want your help
      in another plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two conferred together, and mutual confidence was re-established.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. A NEW HOME IN THE WOODS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      George Melville had no definite destination. He was traveling, not for
      pleasure, but for health, and his purpose was to select a residence in
      some high location, where the dry air would be favorable for his pulmonary
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later he had found a temporary home. One afternoon Herbert and he,
      each on horseback, for at that time public lines of travel were fewer than
      at present, came suddenly upon a neat, one-story cottage in the edge of
      the forest. It stood alone, but it was evidently the home of one who aimed
      to add something of the graces of civilization to the rudeness of frontier
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reined up simultaneously, and Melville, turning to Herbert, said:
      &ldquo;There, Herbert, is my ideal of a residence. I should not be satisfied
      with a rude cabin. There I should find something of the comfort which we
      enjoy in New England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The situation is fine, too,&rdquo; said Herbert, looking about him admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage stood on a knoll. On either side were tall and stately trees.
      A purling brook at the left rolled its silvery current down a gentle
      declivity, and in front, for half a mile, was open country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great mind to call and inquire who lives here.&rdquo; said Melville.
      &ldquo;Perhaps we can arrange to stay here all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a good plan, Mr. Melville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Melville dismounted from his horse, and, approaching, tapped with
      the handle of his whip on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; inquired a smothered voice, as of one rousing himself from
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger, but a friend,&rdquo; answered Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound as of some one moving, and a tall man, clad in a rough
      suit, came to the door, and looked inquiringly at Melville and his boy
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though his attire was rude, his face was refined, and had the indefinable
      air of one who would be more at home in the city than in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to see you both,&rdquo; he said, cordially, offering his hand. &ldquo;I
      don't live in a palace, and my servants are all absent, but if you will
      deign to become my guests I will do what I can for your comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have anticipated my request,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;Let me introduce myself
      as George Melville, an invalid by profession, just come from New England
      in search of health. My young friend here is Herbert Carr, my private
      secretary and faithful companion, who has not yet found out what it is to
      be in poor-health. Without him I should hardly have dared to come so far
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very welcome, Herbert,&rdquo; said the host, with pleasant familiarity.
      &ldquo;Come in, both of you, and make yourselves at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cottage contained two rooms. One was used as a bedchamber, the other
      as a sitting room. On the walls were a few pictures, and on a small
      bookcase against one side of the room were some twenty-five books. There
      was an easel and an unfinished picture in one corner, and a small
      collection of ordinary furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are probably an artist,&rdquo; suggested Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have hit it. I use both pen and pencil,&rdquo; and he mentioned a name
      known to Melville as that of a popular magazine writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not propose to give his real name, but we will know him as Robert
      Falkland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am familiar with your name, Mr. Falkland,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;but I did
      not expect to find you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; answered Falkland. &ldquo;I left the haunts of civilization
      unexpectedly, some months ago, and even my publishers don't know where I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In search of health?&rdquo; queried Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. I did, however, feel in need of a change. I had been running
      in a rut, and wanted to get out of it, so I left my lodgings in New York
      and bought a ticket to St. Louis; arrived there, I determined to come
      farther. So here I have been, living in communion with nature, seeing
      scarcely anybody, enjoying myself, on the whole, but sometimes longing to
      see a new face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have built this cottage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I bought it of its former occupant, but have done something towards
      furnishing it; so that it has become characteristic of me and my tastes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you lived here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months; but my stay is drawing to a close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business that will not be put off calls me back to New York. In fact, I
      had appointed to-morrow for my departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melville and Herbert exchanged a glance. It was evident that the same
      thought was in the mind of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Falkland,&rdquo; said George Melville, &ldquo;I have a proposal to make to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The artist eyed him in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will buy this cottage of you, if you are willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Falkland smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems providential,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We artists and men of letters are apt
      to be short of money, and I confess I was pondering whether my credit was
      good with anybody for a hundred dollars to pay my expenses East. Once
      arrived there, there are plenty of publishers who will make me advances on
      future work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we can probably make a bargain,&rdquo; said Mr. Melville. &ldquo;Please name
      your price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, I do not propose to show my ignorance of real estate values in
      Colorado by naming the price which George Melville paid for his home in
      the wilderness. In fact, I do not know. I can only say that he gave
      Falkland a check for the amount on a Boston bank, and a hundred in cash
      besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are liberal, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Falkland, gratified. &ldquo;I am afraid
      you are not a business man. I have not found that business men overpay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, I am not a business man,&rdquo; answered Melville, &ldquo;though I
      wish my health would admit of my being so. As to the extra hundred
      dollars, I think it worth that much to come upon so comfortable a home
      ready to my hand. It will really be a home, such as the log cabin I looked
      forward to could not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Falkland; &ldquo;I won't pretend that I am indifferent to
      money, for I can't afford to be. I earn considerable sums, but,
      unfortunately, I never could keep money, or provide for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how it would be with me,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;for I am one of
      those, fortunate or otherwise, who are born to a fortune. I have sometimes
      been sorry that I had not the incentive of poverty to induce me to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, suppose we exchange lots,&rdquo; said the artist, lightly. &ldquo;I shouldn't
      object to being wealthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; answered Melville. &ldquo;Give me your health, your
      literary and artistic talent, and it is a bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid they are not transferable,&rdquo; said the artist, &ldquo;but we won't
      prolong the discussion now. I am neglecting the rites of hospitality; I
      must prepare supper for my guests. You must know that here in the
      wilderness I am my own cook and dishwasher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me help you?&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;it is more in my line. I have often
      helped mother at home, and I don't believe you have had any experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I am a green hand,&rdquo; said Melville, laughing, &ldquo;but, as Irish
      girls just imported say, 'I am very willing.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole, I think the boy can assist me better,&rdquo; said Falkland. &ldquo;So,
      Mr. Melville, consider yourself an aristocratic visitor, while Herbert and
      myself, sons of toil, will minister to your necessities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, where do you get your supplies?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight miles away there is a mining camp and store. I ride over there once
      a week or oftener, and bring home what I need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of the camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deer Creek. I will point out to Herbert, before I leave you, the bridle
      path leading to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. It will be a great advantage to us to know just how to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Herbert's help an appetizing repast was prepared, of which all three
      partook with keen zest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Falkland took leave of them, and Melville and his boy
      companion were left to settle down in their new home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. A TERRIBLE MOMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Melville's purchase comprised not only the cottage, but its contents,
      pictures and books included. This was fortunate, for though Herbert, who
      was strong, and fond of outdoor sports, such as hunting and fishing, could
      have contented himself, Melville was easily fatigued, and spent at least
      half of the day in the cabin. The books, most of which were new to him,
      were a great and unfailing resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the articles which Falkland left behind him were two guns, of which
      Herbert and Melville made frequent use. Herbert had a natural taste for
      hunting, though, at home, having no gun of his own, he had not been able
      to gratify his taste as much as he desired. Often after breakfast the two
      sallied forth, and wandered about in the neighboring woods, gun in hand.
      Generally Melville returned first, leaving Herbert, not yet fatigued, to
      continue the sport. In this way our hero acquired a skill and precision of
      aim which enabled him to make a very respectable figure even among old and
      practiced hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, after Melville had returned home, Herbert was led, by the
      ardor of the chase, to wander farther than usual. He was aware of this,
      but did not fear being lost, having a compass and knowing his bearings.
      All at once, as he was making his way along a wooded path, he was startled
      by hearing voices. He hurried forward, and the scene upon which he
      intruded was dramatic enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      With arms folded, a white man, a hunter, apparently, stood erect, and
      facing him, at a distance of seventy-five or eighty feet, was an Indian,
      with gun raised, and leveled at the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you shoot, you red rascal!&rdquo; said the white man. &ldquo;You've got the
      drop on me, I allow, and I am in your power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian laughed in his guttural way; but though he held the gun poised,
      he did not shoot. He was playing with his victim as a cat plays with a
      mouse before she kills it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is white man afraid?&rdquo; said the Indian, not tauntingly, but with real
      curiosity, for among Indians it is considered a great triumph if a warrior
      can inspire fear in his foe, and make him show the white feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; retorted the hunter. &ldquo;Who should I be afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Indian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't flatter yourself, you pesky savage,&rdquo; returned the white man,
      coolly, ejecting a flood of tobacco juice from his mouth, for though he
      was a brave man, he had some drawbacks. &ldquo;You needn't think I am afraid of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian shoot!&rdquo; suggested his enemy, watching the effect of this
      announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, shoot, then, and be done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man no want to live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I want to live. Never saw a healthy white man that didn't. If I
      was goin' to die at all, I wouldn't like to die by the hands of a red
      rascal like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian great warrior,&rdquo; said the dusky denizen of the woods, straightening
      up, and speaking complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian may be great warrior, but he is a horse thief, all the same,&rdquo; said
      the hunter, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man soon die, and Indian wear his scalp,&rdquo; remarked the Indian, in a
      manner likely to disturb the composure of even the bravest listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunter's face changed. It was impossible to reflect upon such a fate
      without a pang. Death was nothing to that final brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! White man afraid now!&rdquo; said the Indian, triumphantly&mdash;quick to
      observe the change of expression in his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not afraid,&rdquo; said the hunter, quickly recovering himself; &ldquo;but
      it's enough to disgust any decent man to think that his scalp will soon be
      dangling from the belt of a filthy heathen like you. However, I suppose I
      won't know it after I'm dead. You have skulked and dogged my steps, you
      red hound, ever since I punished you for trying to steal my horse. I made
      one great mistake. Instead of beating you, I should have shot you, and rid
      the earth of you once for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian no forget white man's blows. White man die, and Indian be
      revenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I s'pose that's what it's coming to,&rdquo; said the hunter, in a tone of
      resignation. &ldquo;I was a 'tarnal fool to come out this mornin' without my
      gun. If I had it you would sing a different song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Indian laughed, a low, guttural, unpleasant laugh, which Herbert
      listened to with a secret shudder. It was so full of malignity, and
      cunning triumph, and so suggestive of the fate which he reserved for his
      white foe, that it aggravated the latter, and made him impatient to have
      the blow fall, since it seemed to be inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you shoot, you red savage?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What are you waiting
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian wished to gloat over the mental distress of his foe. He liked
      to prolong his own feeling of power&mdash;to enjoy the consciousness that,
      at any moment, he could put an end to the life of the man whom he hated
      for the blows which he felt had degraded him, and which he was resolved
      never to forget or forgive. It was the same feeling that has often led
      those of his race to torture their hapless victims, that they may, as long
      as possible, enjoy the spectacle of their agonies. For this reason he was
      in no hurry to speed on its way the fatal bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Indian laughed, and, taking aim, made a feint of firing, but
      withheld his shot. Pale and resolute his intended victim continued to face
      him. He thought that the fatal moment had come, and braced himself to meet
      his fate; but he was destined to be disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is this goin' to last, you red hound?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;If I've got
      to die, I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian can wait!&rdquo; said the savage, with a smile of enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't find it prudent to wait if I were beside you,&rdquo; said the
      hunter. &ldquo;It's easy enough to threaten an unarmed man. If some friend would
      happen along to foil you in your cowardly purpose&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man send for friend!&rdquo; suggested the Indian, tauntingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had listened to this colloquy with varying emotions, and his anger
      and indignation were stirred by the cold-blooded cruelty of the savage. He
      stood motionless, seen by neither party, but he held his weapon leveled at
      the Indian, ready to shoot at an instant's warning. Brought up, as he had
      been, with a horror for scenes of violence, and a feeling that human life
      was sacred, he had a great repugnance to use his weapon, even where it
      seemed his urgent duty to do so. He felt that on him, young as he was,
      rested a weighty responsibility. He could save the life of a man of his
      own color, but only by killing or disabling a red man. Indian though he
      was, his life, too, was sacred; but when he threatened the life of another
      he forfeited his claim to consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert hesitated till he saw it was no longer safe to do so&mdash;till he
      saw that it was the unalterable determination of the Indian to kill the
      hunter, and then, his face pale and fixed, he pulled the trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bullet passed through the shoulder of the savage. The latter uttered a
      shrill cry of surprise and dismay, and his weapon fell at his feet, while
      he pressed his left hand to his wounded shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunter, amazed at the interruption, which had been of such essential
      service to him, lost not a moment in availing himself of it. He bounded
      forward, and before the savage well knew what he purposed, he had picked
      up his fallen weapon, and, leveling it at his wounded foe, fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bullet was not meant to disable, but to kill. It penetrated the heart
      of the savage, and, staggering back, he fell, his face distorted with rage
      and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tables are turned, my red friend!&rdquo; said the hunter, coolly. &ldquo;It's
      your life, not mine, this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Herbert, pale and shocked, but relieved as well, pressed
      forward, and the hunter saw him for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it you, boy, who fired the shot?&rdquo; asked the hunter, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I owe you my life, and that's a debt Jack Holden isn't likely to
      forget!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. JACK HOLDEN ON THE INDIAN QUESTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is a terrible thing to see a man stretched out in death who but a
      minute before stood full of life and strength. Herbert gazed at the dead
      Indian with a strange sensation of pity and relief, and could hardly
      realize that, but for his interposition, it would have been the hunter,
      not the Indian, who would have lost his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunter was more used to such scenes, and his calmness was unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the end of the dog!&rdquo; he said, touching with his foot the dead
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made him want to kill you?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenge,&rdquo; answered Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what? Had you injured him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way he looked at it. One day I caught the varmint stealin' my
      best hoss. He'd have got away with him, too, if I hadn't come home just as
      I did. I might have shot him&mdash;most men would&mdash;but I hate to take
      a man's life for stealin'; and I took another way. My whip was lyin'
      handy, and I took it and lashed the rascal over his bare back a dozen
      times, and then told him to dust, or I'd serve him worse. He left, but
      there was an ugly look in his eyes, and I knew well enough he'd try to get
      even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most a year. It's a long time, but an Indian never forgets an injury or
      an insult, and I knew that he was only bidin' his time. So I always went
      armed, and kept a good lookout. It was only this mornin' that he caught me
      at a disadvantage. I'd been taking a walk, and left my gun at home. He was
      prowlin' round, and soon saw how things stood. He'd have killed me sure,
      if you hadn't come in the nick of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I was near,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;but it seems to me a terrible thing
      to shoot a man. I'm glad it wasn't I that killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe it was better for me, as he was my enemy,&rdquo; said Jack Holden. &ldquo;It
      won't trouble my conscience a mite. I don't look upon an Indian as a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a snake in the grass&mdash;a poisonous serpent, that's what I call
      him,&rdquo; said Jack Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert shook his head. He couldn't assent to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel different, no doubt. You're a tenderfoot. You ain't used to the
      ways of these reptiles. You haven't seen what I have,&rdquo; answered Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo; asked Herbert, judging correctly that Holden
      referred to some special experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you. You see, I'm an old settler in this Western country. I've
      traveled pretty much all over the region beyond the Rockies, and I've seen
      a good deal of the red men. I know their ways as well as any man. Well, I
      was trampin' once in Montany, when, one afternoon, I and my pard&mdash;he
      was prospectin'&mdash;came to a clearin', and there we saw a sight that
      made us all feel sick. It was the smokin' ruins of a log cabin, which them
      devils had set on fire. But that wasn't what I referred to. Alongside
      there lay six dead bodies&mdash;the man, his wife, two boys, somewhere
      near your age, a little girl, of maybe ten, and a baby&mdash;all butchered
      by them savages, layin'&mdash;in the hunter's vernacular&mdash;in their
      gore. It was easy to see how they'd killed the baby, by his broken skull.
      They had seized the poor thing by the feet, and swung him against the side
      of the house, dashin' out his brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert shuddered, and felt sick, as the picture of the ruined home and
      the wretched family rose before his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Indians that did it, of course,&rdquo; proceeded Holden. &ldquo;They're born
      savage, and such things come natural to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there no good Indians?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be,&rdquo; answered Jack Holden, doubtfully, &ldquo;though I haven't seen
      many. They're as scarce as plums in a boardin' house puddin', I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I present this as Jack Holden's view, not mine. He had the prejudices of
      the frontier, and frontiersmen are severe judges of their Indian
      neighbors. They usually look at but one side of the picture, and are not
      apt to take into consideration the wrongs which the Indians have
      undeniably received. There is another extreme, however, and the
      sentimentalists who deplore Indian wrongs, and represent them as a brave,
      suffering and oppressed people, are quite as far away from a just view of
      the Indian question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your name, youngster?&rdquo; asked Holden, with the curiosity natural
      under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert Carr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live nigh here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert indicated, as well as he could, the location of his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;you live with Mr. Falkland. Are you his son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mr. Falkland has gone away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not living there alone, be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I came out here with a young man&mdash;Mr. Melville. He bought the
      cottage of Mr. Falkland, who was obliged to go East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so. Why, we're neighbors. I live three miles from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know Mr. Falkland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we used to see each other now and then. He was a good fellow, but
      mighty queer. What's the use of settin' down and paintin' pictures? What's
      the good of it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you admire pictures, Mr. Holden?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's that you called me? I didn't quite catch on to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Holden. Isn't that your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't call me mister. I'm plain Jack Holden. Call me Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will if you prefer it,&rdquo; said Herbert, dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. We don't go much on style in the woods. Won't you come
      home with me, and take a look at my cabin? I ain't used to company, but we
      can sit down and have a social smoke together, and then I'll manage to
      find something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Holden&mdash;I mean, Jack&mdash;but I must be getting
      home; Mr. Melville will be feeling anxious, for, as it is, I shall be
      late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Melville, as you call him, any way kin to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is my friend and employer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is about twenty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you two been out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much over a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn't Melville with you this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in delicate health&mdash;consumption&mdash;and he gets tired sooner
      than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must come over and see you, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will. We get lonely sometimes. If you would like to borrow
      something to read, Mr. Melville has plenty of books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read!&rdquo; repeated Jack. &ldquo;No, thank you. I don't care much for books. A
      newspaper, now, is different. A man likes to know what's going on in the
      world; but I leave books to ministers, schoolmasters, and the like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't read, how do you fill up your time, Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pipe's better than any book, lad. I'm goin' to set down and have a
      smoke now. Wish I had an extra pipe for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Herbert, politely, &ldquo;but I don't smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't smoke! How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen years old, and don't smoke! Why, where was you raised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the East,&rdquo; answered Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I smoked before I was three foot high, I was goin' to say. I
      couldn't get along without smokin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I without reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, folks will have their different tastes, I allow. I reckon I'll be
      goin' back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan't you bury him?&rdquo; asked Herbert, with a glance at the dead Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he wouldn't have buried me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won't leave him here? If you'll bury him, I'll help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, boy. Since you make a point of it, I'll come round to-morrow,
      and dig a hole to put him in. I'll take the liberty of carryin' home his
      shootin' iron. He won't need it where he's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two parted in a friendly manner, and Herbert turned his face homeward,
      grave and thoughtful.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. THE BLAZING STAR MINE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Toward noon the next day George Melville and Herbert were resting from a
      country trip, sitting on a rude wooden settee which our hero had made of
      some superfluous boards, and placed directly in front of the house, when a
      figure was seen approaching with long strides from the shadow of the
      neighboring woods. It was not until he was close at hand that Herbert
      espied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's Mr. Holden!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Holden, my lad,&rdquo; said the hunter, correcting him. &ldquo;Is this the man
      you're living with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack Holden was unconventional, and had been brought up in a rude school
      so far as manners were concerned. It did not occur to him that his
      question might have been better framed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Melville,&rdquo; answered that gentleman, seeing that Herbert looked
      embarrassed. &ldquo;Herbert is my constant and valued companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a trump, that boy!&rdquo; continued Holden. &ldquo;Why, if it hadn't been for
      him, there'd been an end of Jack Holden yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert told me about it. It was indeed a tragic affair. The sacrifice of
      life is deplorable, but seemed to have been necessary, unless, indeed, you
      could have disabled him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disabled him!&rdquo; echoed the hunter. &ldquo;That wouldn't have answered by a long
      shot. As soon as the reptile got well he'd have been on my trail ag'in.
      No, sir; it was my life or his, and I don't complain of the way things
      turned out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you buried him?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've shoved him under, and it's better than he deserved, the
      sneakin' rascal. I'm glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Melville. Didn't
      know I had changed neighbors till the boy there told me yesterday. I've
      tramped over this mornin' to give you a call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Mr. Holden. Sit down here beside us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm more at home here,&rdquo; answered Holden, stretching himself on the
      ground, and laying his gun beside him. &ldquo;How do you like Colorado?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, as far as I have seen it,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;Herbert probably
      told you my object, in coming here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said you were ailin' some way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lungs are weak. Since I have been here, I am feeling better and
      stronger, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There don't seem to be anything the matter with the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but a healthy appetite,&rdquo; answered Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't hurt anybody. Mr. Melville, do you smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer! Don't see how you can do without it? Why, sir, I'd been homesick
      without my pipe. It's company, I tell you, when a chap's alone and got no
      one to speak to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it, Mr. Holden, you are not here for your health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should say not; I'm tough as a hickory nut. When I drop off it's
      more likely to be an Indian bullet than any disease. I'm forty-seven years
      old, and I don't know what it is to be sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fortunate, Mr. Holden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect I am. But I haven't answered your question. I'm interested in
      mines, Mr. Melville. Have you ever been to Deer Creek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I went over with Herbert to visit the store there one day last
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of the Blazing Star Mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I own it,&rdquo; said Holden. &ldquo;It's a good mine, and would make me rich if I
      had a little more money to work it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the indications favorable, then?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks well, if that's what you mean. Yes, sir; the Star is a
      first-class property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's a pity you don't work it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I say myself. Mr. Melville, I've a proposal to make to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Holden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could manage to call me Jack, it would seem more social like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, then, Jack!&rdquo; said Melville smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me money enough to develop the mine, and I'll make half of it
      over to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is needed?&rdquo; asked Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not over five hundred dollars. It's a bargain, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not myself wish to assume any business cares,&rdquo; said Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Holden looked disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Herbert may feel differently,&rdquo; continued Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like the lad for a partner,&rdquo; said Holden, briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have no money!&rdquo; said Herbert, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Melville smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the mine is a good one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will advance you the money
      necessary for the purchase of a half interest. If it pays you, you may
      become rich. Then you can repay the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose it doesn't, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; objected Herbert, &ldquo;how can I ever
      repay you so large a sum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole, Herbert, I will take the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, his face glowing with
      anticipation. To be half owner of a mine, with the chance of making a
      large sum of money, naturally elated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I be, Herbert? But I want to see the mine first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you go over this afternoon?&rdquo; asked Holden, eager to settle the
      matter as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long journey,&rdquo; said Melville, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stay overnight,&rdquo; said Jack Holden, &ldquo;and come back in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; let us go then&mdash;that is, after dinner. Herbert, if you
      will set the table, we will see if we can't offer our friend here some
      refreshment. He is hungry, I am sure, after his long walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've hit it, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Holden. &ldquo;I allow I'm as hungry as a
      wolf. But you don't set down to table, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Melville, smiling pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't used to it,&rdquo; said Holden; &ldquo;but I was once. Anyhow, it won't make
      no difference in the victuals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was ready the three sat down, and did ample justice to it; but
      Jack Holden made such furious onslaughts that the other two could hardly
      keep pace with him. Fortunately, there was plenty of food, for Melville
      did not believe in economical housekeeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they set out for Deer Creek. As has been already explained,
      it was the name of a mining settlement. Now, by the way, it is a
      prosperous town, though the name has been changed. Then, however,
      everything was rude and primitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Holden led the way to the Blazing Star Mine, and pointed out its
      capabilities and promise. He waited with some anxiety for Melville's
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand matters very well,&rdquo; said Melville, &ldquo;but I am willing
      to take a good deal on trust. If you desire it, I will buy half the mine,
      paying you five hundred dollars for that interest. That is, I buy it for
      Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted Holden. &ldquo;Give us your hand, pard. You are my partner
      now, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he gripped Herbert's hand in a pressure which was so strong as
      to be painful, and the necessary business was gone through.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Herbert found himself a half owner of the Blazing Star Mine, of Deer
      Creek, Colorado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your mine will turn out well, Herbert,&rdquo; said Melville, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it might for mother's sake!&rdquo; said Herbert, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be my fault if it don't,&rdquo; said his partner. &ldquo;I shall stay here
      now, and get to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought I not to help you?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mr. Melville will want you. I will hire a man here to help me, and
      charge it to your share of the expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the matter was arranged; but Herbert rode over two or three times a
      week to look after his property.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. GOOD NEWS FROM THE MINE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Herbert, what news from the mine?&rdquo; asked Melville, two weeks later,
      on Herbert's return from Deer Creek, whither he had gone alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some rich developments, so Jack says. Do you know, Mr.
      Melville, he says the mine is richly worth five thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Herbert! That would make your half worth twenty-five hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy complacently; &ldquo;if we could sell at that figure, I
      could pay you back and have two thousand dollars of my own. Think of that,
      Mr. Melville,&rdquo; continued Herbert, his eyes glowing with pride and
      pleasure. &ldquo;Shouldn't I be a rich boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do even better, Herbert. Don't be in a hurry to sell. That is my
      advice. If the present favorable indications continue, you may realize a
      considerably larger sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Jack says. He says he is bound to hold on, and hopes I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in luck, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Melville, and I don't forget that it is to you I am indebted for
      this good fortune,&rdquo; said the boy, earnestly. &ldquo;If you hadn't bought the
      property for me, I could not. I don't know but you ought to get some share
      ef the profits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Melville shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have more than my share of money already.
      Sometimes I feel ashamed when I compare my lot with others, and consider
      that for the money I have, I have done no work. The least I can do is to
      consider myself the Lord's trustee, and do good to others, when it falls
      in my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish all rich men thought as you do, Mr. Melville; the world would be
      happier,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Herbert. I hope and believe there is a considerable number who,
      like myself, feel under obligations to do good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad, on mother's account, if I can go home with money
      enough to make her independent of work. By the way, Mr. Melville, I found
      a letter from mother in the Deer Creek post office. Shall I read it to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is nothing private in it, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing private from you, Mr. Melville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be explained that Deer Creek had already obtained such prominence
      that the post-office department had established an office there, and
      learning this, Herbert had requested his mother to address him at that
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the letter from his pocket and read it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      We quote the essential portions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I am very glad to hear that you have made the long journey in safety,
      and are now in health.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had not mentioned in his home letter the stage-coach adventure,
      for he knew that it would disturb his mother to think that he had been
      exposed to such a risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do no good, you know,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Melville, and his friend
      had agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is very satisfactory to me,' continued Herbert, reading from the
      letter, 'that you are under the charge of Mr. Melville, who seems to me an
      excellent, conscientious young man, from whom you can learn only good.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother thinks very kindly of me,&rdquo; said Melville, evidently pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is right, too, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Herbert, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It will no doubt be improving to you, my dear Herbert, to travel under
      such pleasant auspices, for a boy can learn from observation as well as
      from books. I miss you very much, but since the separation is for your
      advantage, I can submit to it cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You ask me about my relations with Mr. Graham. I am still in the post
      office, and thus far nearly the whole work devolves upon me. Except in one
      respect, I am well treated. Mr. G-. is, as you know, very penurious, and
      grudges every cent that he has to pay out. When he paid me last Saturday
      night the small sum for which I agreed to assist him, he had much to say
      about his large expenses, fuel, lights, etc., and asked me if I wouldn't
      agree to work for two dollars a week, instead of three. I confess, I was
      almost struck dumb by such an exhibition of meanness, and told him that it
      would be quite impossible. Since then he has spent some of the time
      himself in the office, and asked me various questions about the proper way
      of preparing the mail, etc., and I think it is his intention, if possible,
      to get along without me. I don't know, if he absolutely insists upon it,
      but it would be better to accept the reduction than to give up altogether.
      Two dollars a week will count in my small household.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of such meanness, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; demanded Herbert,
      indignantly. &ldquo;Here is Mr. Graham making, I am sure, two thousand dollars a
      year clear profit, and yet anxious to reduce mother from three to two
      dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly a very small business, Herbert. I think some men become
      meaner by indulgence of their defect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall write mother to give up the place sooner than submit to such a
      reduction. Three dollars a week is small enough in all conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I approve the advice, Herbert. If Mr. Graham were really cramped for
      money, and doing a poor business, it would be different. As it is, it
      seems to me he has no excuse for his extreme penuriousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pleasant it would be to pay a flying visit to Wayneboro,&rdquo; said
      Herbert, thoughtfully. &ldquo;One never appreciates home until he has left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That pleasure must be left for the future. It will keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, and when I do go home I want to go well fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had already caught the popular Western phrase for a man well to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must depend on the Blazing Star Mine for that,&rdquo; said Melville,
      smiling. My young readers may like to know that, while Herbert was
      prospering financially, he did not neglect the cultivation of his mind.
      Among the books left by Mr. Falkland were a number of standard histories,
      some elementary books in French, including a dictionary, a treatise on
      natural philosophy, and a German grammar and reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything of French or German, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; inquired our
      hero, when they made their first examination of the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Herbert, I am a tolerable scholar in each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to study them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will make you a proposal. You are likely to have considerable time
      at your disposal. If you will study either, or both, I will be your
      teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like nothing better,&rdquo; said Herbert, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, if you wish to study philosophy, I will aid you, though we are
      not in a position to illustrate the subject by experiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was a sensible boy. Moreover, he was fond of study, and he saw at
      once how advantageous this proposal was. He secured a private tutor for
      nothing, and, as he soon found, an excellent one. Though Mr. Melville had
      never been a teacher, he had an unusual aptitude for teaching, and it is
      hard to decide whether he or Herbert enjoyed more the hours which they now
      regularly passed in the relation of teacher and pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be said, also, that while George Melville evinced an aptitude for
      teaching, Herbert showed an equal aptitude for learning. The tasks which
      he voluntarily undertook most boys would have found irksome, but he only
      found them a source of pleasure, and had the satisfaction, after a very
      short time, to find himself able to read ordinary French and German prose
      with comparative ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had a better pupil,&rdquo; said George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am the first you ever had,&rdquo; said Herbert, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. I spoke as if I were a veteran teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't be too much elated by the compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXXIV. TWO OLD ACQUAINTANCES REAPPEAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the rude hotel kept by the outlaw, whom we have introduced under the
      name of Brown, there sat two men, to neither of whom will my readers need
      an introduction. They have already appeared in our story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was Brown himself, the other Col. Warner, or, as we may as well
      confess, Jerry Lane, known throughout the West as an unscrupulous robber
      and chief of a band of road agents, whose depredations had been
      characterized by audacity and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown was ostensibly an innkeeper, but this business, honest enough in
      itself, only veiled the man's real trade, in which he defied alike the
      laws of honesty and of his country. The other was by turns a gentleman of
      property, a merchant, a cattle owner, or a speculator, in all of which
      characters he acted excellently, and succeeded in making the acquaintance
      of men whom he designed to rob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men wore a sober look. In their business, as in those more
      legitimate, there are good times and dull times, and of late they had not
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want some money, captain,&rdquo; said Brown, sullenly, laying down a black
      pipe, which he had been smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, Brown,&rdquo; answered Warner, as we will continue to call him. &ldquo;It's
      a dry time with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand me, captain,&rdquo; continued Brown. &ldquo;I want you to give
      me some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First you must tell me where I am to get it,&rdquo; answered Warner, with a
      shrug of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you have no money?&rdquo; asked Brown, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because in all our enterprises you have taken the lion's share, though
      you haven't always done the chief part. You can't have spent the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not quite; but I have nothing to spare. I need to travel about, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a soft thing,&rdquo; grumbled Brown. &ldquo;You go round and have a good
      time while I am tied down to this fourth-rate tavern in the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn't much more than that,&rdquo; said Warner, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to keep a first-class hotel?&rdquo; demanded Brown, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not. Brown,&rdquo; continued Warner, soothingly, &ldquo;don't let us
      quarrel; we can't afford it. Let us talk together reasonably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, that it isn't my fault if things have gone wrong. Was it my fault
      that we found so little cash in that last store we broke open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen dollars!&rdquo; muttered Brown, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen dollars, as you say. It didn't pay us for our trouble. Well, I
      was as sorry as you. I fail to see how it was my fault. Better luck next
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is the next time to be?&rdquo; asked Brown, somewhat placated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you. You remember that stagecoach full of passengers that
      fooled us some time since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always meant to get on the track of that Melville, who spoiled our plot
      by overhearing us and giving us away to the passengers. He is very rich,
      so the boy who was with him told me, and I have every reason to rely upon
      his statement. Well, I want to be revenged upon him, and, at the same
      time, to relieve him of the doubtless large sum of money which he keeps
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only recently ascertained&mdash;no matter how. He lives in a small
      cabin, far from any other, about eight miles from the mining town of Deer
      Creek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. No one lives there with him except the boy, and it would be
      easy enough to rob him. I saw a man from Deer Creek yesterday. He tells me
      that Melville has bought for the boy a half share in a rich mine, and is
      thought to have at least five thousand dollars in gold and bills in his
      cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown's eyes glistened with cupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a big haul,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it would. Now, Brown, while you have been grumbling at me I
      have been saving this little affair for our benefit&mdash;yours and mine.
      We won't let any of the rest of them into it, but whatever we find we will
      divide, and share alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean this, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean it, friend Brown. You shan't charge me with taking the lion's
      share in this case. If there are five thousand dollars, as my informant
      seems to think, your share shall be half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five hundred dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; twenty-five hundred dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will pay for my hard luck lately,&rdquo; said Brown, his face clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very handsomely, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall we start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning. We will set out early in the morning; and, by the way,
      Brown, it's just as well not to let your wife or anyone else know where we
      are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Brown, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the two worthies set out their far from meritorious
      errand. Brown told his wife vaguely, in reply to her questioning, that he
      was called away for a few days on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he expected to evade further question by this answer, he was mistaken.
      Mrs. Brown was naturally of a jealous and suspicious temperament, and
      doubt was excited in her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I say you have gone if I am asked?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say that you don't know,&rdquo; answered Brown, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think much of a man who keeps secrets from his wife,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Brown, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don't think much of a man who tells everything to his wife,&rdquo;
       retorted Brown. &ldquo;It's all right, Kitty, You needn't concern yourself. But
      the captain and I are on an expedition, which, to be successful, needs to
      be kept secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brown was not more than half convinced, but she was compelled to
      accept this statement, for her husband would vouchsafe no other.
    </p>
    <p>
      That part of the State into which they journeyed was not new ground to
      either. They were familiar with all the settled portion of Colorado, and
      had no difficulty in finding the cabin occupied by George Melville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that they reached the modest dwelling in the woods about
      three o'clock in the afternoon. Herbert had ridden over to Deer Creek to
      look after his mining property, and it was not yet time to expect him
      back. George Melville was therefore left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing, as my young readers do, his literary tastes, they will understand
      that, though left alone, he was not lonely. The stock of books which he
      had bought from his predecessor was to him an unfailing resource.
      Moreover, he had taken up Italian, of which he knew a little, and was
      reading in the original the &ldquo;Divina Comedia&rdquo; of Dante, a work which
      consumed many hours, and was not likely soon to be over. To-day, however,
      for some reason Melville found it more difficult than usual to fix his
      mind upon his pleasant study. Was it a presentiment of coming evil that
      made him so unusually restless? At all events, the hours, which were wont
      to be fleet-footed, passed with unusual slowness, and he found himself
      longing for the return of his young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what has got into me to-day,&rdquo; said Melville to himself.
      &ldquo;It's only three o'clock, yet the day seems very long. I wish Herbert
      would return. I feel uneasy. I don't know why. I hope it is not a presage
      of misfortune. I shall not be sure that something has not happened to
      Herbert till I see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke George Melville rose from his chair, and was about to put on
      his hat and take a short walk in the neighboring woods, when he heard the
      tramp of approaching horses. Looking out from the window, he saw two
      horsemen close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started in dismay, for in the two men he was at no loss in recognizing
      his stagecoach companion, Col. Warner, and the landlord who had essayed
      the part of a road agent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. MELVILLE IN PERIL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Col. Warner and his companion enjoyed the effect of their presence upon
      their intended victim, and smiled in a manner that boded little good to
      Melville, as they dismounted from their steeds and advanced to the door of
      the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Melville?&rdquo; said Warner, ironically. &ldquo;I see you have not
      forgotten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not forgotten you,&rdquo; answered Melville, regarding his visitor
      uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my friend, Mr. Brown. Perhaps you remember him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do remember him, and the circumstances under which I last saw him,&rdquo;
       replied Melville, rather imprudently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown frowned, but he did not speak. He generally left his companion to do
      the talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being in the neighborhood, we thought we'd call upon you,&rdquo; continued Col.
      Warner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk in, gentlemen, if you see fit,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;I suppose it would
      be only polite to say that I am glad to see you, but I have some regard
      for truth, and cannot say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire your candor, Mr. Melville. Walk in, Brown. Ha! upon my word, you
      have a nice home here. Didn't expect to see anything of the kind in this
      wilderness. Books and pictures! Really, now, Brown, I am quite tempted to
      ask our friend, Melville, to entertain us for a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it would suit you,&rdquo; said Melville, dryly. &ldquo;You are probably
      more fond of exciting adventure than of books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the boy live with you?&rdquo; asked Warner, dropping his bantering tone,
      and looking about his searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is still with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has gone to Deer Creek on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Melville saw the rapid glance of satisfaction interchanged by the two
      visitors he realized that he had made an imprudent admission. He suspected
      that their design was to rob him, and he had voluntarily assured them that
      he was alone, and that they could proceed without interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry not to see him,&rdquo; said Warner. &ldquo;I'd like to renew our pleasant
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melville was about to reply that Herbert would be back directly, when it
      occurred to him that this would be a fresh piece of imprudence. It would
      doubtless lead them to proceed at once to the object of their visit, while
      if he could only keep them till his boy companion did actually return,
      they would at least be two to two. Even then they would be by no means
      equally matched, but something might occur to help them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Herbert will return by evening,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You can see him
      if you remain till then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another expression of satisfaction appeared upon the faces of his two
      visitors, but for this he was prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry we can't stay till then,&rdquo; said Warner, &ldquo;but business of importance
      will limit our stay. Eh, Brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see the use of delaying at all!&rdquo; growled Brown, who was not as
      partial as his companion to the feline amusement of playing with his
      intended victim. With him, on the contrary, it was a word, and a blow, and
      sometimes the blow came first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to business!&rdquo; continued Brown, impatiently, addressing his
      associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my purpose, friend Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Melville, it is not solely the pleasure of seeing you that has led my
      friend and myself to call this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melville nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I supposed,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a little unfinished business between us, as you will remember. I
      owe you a return for the manner in which you saw fit to throw suspicion
      upon me some time since, when we were traveling together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad to have you convince me that I did you an
      injustice,&rdquo; said Melville. &ldquo;I was led to believe that you and your friend
      now present were leagued together to rob us of our money and valuables. If
      it was not so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not very far from right, Mr. Melville. Still it was not polite
      to express your suspicions so rudely. Besides, you were instrumental in
      defeating our plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't express any regret for that, Col. Warner, or Jerry Lane, as I
      suppose that is your real name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Jerry Lane!&rdquo; said Warner, proudly. &ldquo;I may as well confess it, since
      it is well that you should know with whom you have to deal. When I say
      that I am Jerry Lane, you will understand that I mean business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Melville, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me by reputation?&rdquo; said the outlaw, with a curious pride in his
      unenviable notoriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do men say of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are at the head of a gang of reckless assassins and outlaws, and
      that you have been implicated in scores of robberies and atrocities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not so satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Lane&mdash;to drop his false name&mdash;&ldquo;I advise you to
      be careful how you talk. It may be the worse for you. Now, to come to
      business, how much money have you in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask, and by what right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We propose to take it. Now answer my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, you will be very poorly paid for the trouble you have taken in
      visiting me. I have very little money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you say so. We want an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as I can remember I have between forty and fifty dollars in my
      pocketbook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown uttered an oath under his breath, and Lane looked uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a lie!&rdquo; said Brown, speaking first. &ldquo;We were told you had five
      thousand dollars here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your informant was badly mistaken, then. I am not very wise, perhaps, in
      worldly matters, but I certainly am not such a fool as to keep so large a
      sum of money in a lonely cabin like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not so much as that,&rdquo; returned Lane. &ldquo;I don't pretend to say how
      much you have. That is for you to tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Melville drew from his pocket a wallet, and passed it to the
      outlaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count the money for yourself, if you wish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can verify my
      statement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lane opened the wallet with avidity, and drew out the contents. It was
      apparent at the first glance that the sum it contained was small. It was
      counted, however, and proved to amount to forty-seven dollars and a few
      silver coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two robbers looked at each other in dismay. Was it possible that this
      was all? If so, they would certainly be very poorly paid for their
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect us to believe, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Jerry Lane, sternly,
      &ldquo;that this is all the money you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this cabin&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not so easily fooled. It is probably all you carry about with you;
      but you have more concealed somewhere about the premises. It will be best
      for you to produce at once, unless you are ready to pass in your checks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means,&rdquo; said Melville, growing pale in spite of himself, for he knew
      from report the desperate character of his guests, &ldquo;that means, I suppose,
      that you will kill me unless I satisfy your rapacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said Lane, curtly. &ldquo;Now for your answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I cannot accomplish impossibilities. It is as I say. The money
      in your hands is all that I have by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to deny that you are rich?&rdquo; asked Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not deny it. That is not the point in question. You ask me to
      produce all the money I have with me. I have done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe this, Brown?&rdquo; asked the captain, turning to his
      subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strictly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;you deserve to die for having no more money for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; chimed in Lane. &ldquo;Once more, will you produce your secret hoard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must be dealt with in the usual way. Brown, have you a rope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a convenient tree near by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll find one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two seized Melville, and, despite his resistance, dragged him
      violently from the cabin, and adjusted a rope about his neck. The young
      man was pale, and gave himself up for lost.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. THE MINE IS SOLD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While his friend was in peril, where was Herbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      For him, too, it had been an exciting day&mdash;Deer Creek had been
      excited by the arrival of a capitalist from New York, whose avowed errand
      it was to buy a mine. Reports from Deer Creek had turned his steps
      thither, and all the mine owners were on the qui vive to attract the
      attention of the monied man. It was understood that he intended to
      capitalize the mine, when purchased, start a company, and work it by the
      new and improved methods, which had replaced the older and ruder
      appliances at first employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Compton, though not a mining expert, was a shrewd man, who weighed
      carefully the representations that were made to him, and reserved his
      opinion. It was clear that he was not a man who would readily be taken in,
      though there were not wanting men at Deer Creek who were ready to palm off
      upon him poor or worthless mines. About the only mine owners who did not
      seek him were the owners of the Blazing Star, both of whom were on the
      ground. The mine was looking up. The most recent developments were the
      most favorable, and the prospects were excellent. They might, indeed,
      &ldquo;peter out&rdquo; as the expression is, but it did not seem likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;shall we invite Mr. Compton to visit our mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jack Holden; &ldquo;I am willing to keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't you sell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if I could get my price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five thousand dollars for the whole mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is twelve thousand five hundred for mine,&rdquo; said Herbert, his cheek
      flushing with the excitement he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've figured it out right, my lad,&rdquo; said his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would leave me twelve thousand after I have paid up Mr. Melville for
      the sum I paid in the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right again, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert. &ldquo;Do you know what that means? It means
      that I should be rich&mdash;that my mother could move into a nicer house,
      that we could live at ease for the rest of our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would twelve thousand dollars do all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it would give me a fund that would establish me in business, and
      relieve me of all anxiety. Jack, it's too bright to be real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may not be able to sell the mine at that figure, Herbert. Don't let us
      count our chickens before they are hatched, or we may be disappointed. I'm
      as willin' to keep the mine as to sell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, here is Mr. Compton coming,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capitalist paused, and addressing Herbert, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to do with the mine, my lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am half owner,&rdquo; answered Herbert, promptly, and not without pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the other half owner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Holden,&rdquo; answered Herbert, pointing out Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I examine the mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite welcome to, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Possibly the fact that this mine alone had not been pressed upon him for
      purchase, predisposed Mr. Compton to regard it with favor. Every facility
      was offered him, and Jack Holden, who thoroughly understood his business,
      gave him the necessary explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour spent in the examination, Mr. Compton came to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the mine for sale?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your lowest price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack Holden wasted no words in praising the mine, and this produced a
      favorable impression on the capitalist with whom he was dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's a bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert found it difficult to realize that these few words had made him a
      rich boy. He remained silent, but in his heart he was deeply thankful, not
      so much for himself, as because he knew that he was now able to rejoice
      his mother's heart, and relieve her from all pecuniary cares or anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've made a good bargain, sir, if I do say it,&rdquo; said Jack Holden. &ldquo;For
      my own part, I wasn't so particular about selling the mine, but my young
      partner here is differently placed, and the money will come handy to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rather young for a mine owner,&rdquo; said Mr. Compton, regarding
      Herbert with some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I believe I am the youngest mine owner here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a resident of this State?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only temporarily, sir. I came here with a friend whose lungs are weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expect to return to the East soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you do, come to see me. I am a commission merchant in Boston. If it
      is your intention to follow a business life, I may be able to find you a
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir; I should like nothing better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Mr. Compton, &ldquo;I will come here and complete the
      purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Herbert, when the new purchaser of the mine had left them,
      &ldquo;there is no work for us here. Come with me, and let us together tell Mr.
      Melville the good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good thought, my lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the two mounted their horses, and left Deer Creek behind them. They
      little suspected how sorely they were needed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. TO THE RESCUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Herbert and his companion drew near the forest cabin, which had been the
      home of the former, without a suspicion that George Melville was in such
      dire peril. The boy was, indeed, thinking of him, but it was rather of the
      satisfaction his employer would feel at his good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow I feel in a great hurry to get there, Jack,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;I
      shall enjoy telling Mr. Melville of my good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a fine chap, that Melville,&rdquo; said Jack Holden, meaning no disrespect
      by this unceremonious fashion of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is! He's the best friend I ever had, Jack,&rdquo; returned Herbert,
      warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pity he's ailing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's much stronger than he was when he came out here. All the
      unfavorable symptoms have disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he'll outgrow it. I had an uncle that was given up to die of
      consumption, when he was about Melville's age, and he died only last year
      at the age of seventy-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must have been slow consumption, Jack,&rdquo; said Herbert, smiling. &ldquo;If
      Mr. Melville can live as long as that, I think neither he nor his friends
      will have reason to complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he so rich, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how rich, but I know he has plenty of money. How much power
      a rich man has,&rdquo; said Herbert, musingly. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Melville has changed my
      whole life for me. When I first met him I was working for three dollars a
      week. Now I am worth twelve thousand dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert repeated this with a beaming face. The good news had not lost the
      freshness of novelty. There was so much that he could do now that he was
      comparatively rich. To do Herbert justice, it was not of himself
      principally that he thought. It was sweet to reflect that he could bring
      peace, and joy, and independence to his mother. After all, it is the
      happiness we confer that brings us the truest enjoyment. The selfish man
      who eats and drinks and lodges like a prince, but is unwilling to share
      his abundance with others, knows not what he loses. Even boys and girls
      may try the experiment for themselves, for one does not need to be rich to
      give pleasure to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Jack, let us ride faster; I am in a hurry,&rdquo; said Herbert, when they
      were perhaps a quarter of a mile distant from the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They emerged from the forest, and could now see the cottage and its
      surroundings. They saw something that almost paralyzed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Melville, with a rope round his neck, stood beneath a tree. Col.
      Warner was up in the tree swinging the rope over a branch, while Brown,
      big, burly and brutal, pinioned the helpless young man in his strong arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! Do you see that?&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert. &ldquo;It is the road
      agents. Quick, or we shall be too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack had seen. He had not only seen, but he had already acted. Quick as
      thought he raised his weapon, and covered Brown. There was a sharp report,
      and the burly ruffian fell, his heart pierced by the unerring bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert dashed forward, and, seizing the rope, released his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven, Herbert! You have saved my life!&rdquo; murmured Melville, in
      tones of heartfelt gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another of them!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack Holden, looking up into the
      tree, and he raised his gun once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't shoot!&rdquo; exclaimed the man, whom we know best as Col. Warner; &ldquo;I'll
      come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he did, but not in the manner he expected. In his flurry, for he was
      not a brave man, outlaw though he was, he lost his hold and fell at the
      feet of Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do with him, Mr. Melville?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;He deserves to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't kill him! Bind him, and give him up to the authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to let him off so easy,&rdquo; said Jack, but he did as Melville wished.
      But the colonel had a short reprieve. On his way to jail, a bullet from
      some unknown assailant pierced his temple, and Jerry Lane, the notorious
      road agent, died, as he had lived, by violence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had been the intention of George Melville to remain in Colorado all
      winter, but his improved health, and the tragic event which I have just
      narrated, conspired to change his determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; he said, when the business connected with the sale of the mine
      had been completed, &ldquo;how would you like to go home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you don't suppose I would remain here alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel well enough, Mr. Melville, there is nothing I should like
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do feel well enough. If I find any unfavorable symptoms coming back, I
      can travel again, but I am anxious to get away from this place, where I
      have come so near losing my life at the hands of the outlaws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was little need of delay. Their preparations were soon made. There
      was an embarrassment about the cottage, but that was soon removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll buy it of you, Mr. Melville,&rdquo; said Jack Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't sell it to you, Mr. Holden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you a fair price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand me,&rdquo; said George Melville, smiling. &ldquo;I will not sell
      it, because I prefer to give it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr Melville, but you know I am not exactly a poor man. The
      sale of the mine&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Melville, with emotion, &ldquo;would you have me forget that it is
      to you and Herbert that I owe my rescue from a violent and ignominious
      death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no pay for that, Mr. Melville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sure you don't. But you will accept the cabin, not as pay, but
      as a mark of my esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon that ground Jack accepted the cottage with pleasure. Herbert tried to
      tempt him to make a visit to the East, but he was already in treaty for
      another mine, and would not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stayed a day in Chicago on their way to Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Eben is still here?&rdquo; thought Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon had his question answered. In passing through a suburban portion
      of the great city, he saw a young man sawing wood in front of a mean
      dwelling, while a stout negro was standing near, with his hands in his
      pockets, surveying the job. He was the proprietor of a colored restaurant,
      and Eben was working for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, for Eben! The once spruce dry-goods clerk was now a
      miserable-looking tramp, so far as outward appearances went. His clothes
      were not only ragged, but soiled, and the spruce city acquaintances whom
      he once knew would have passed him without recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben turned swiftly as he heard his name called, and a flush of shame
      overspread his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Herbert?&rdquo; he asked, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Eben. You don't seem very prosperous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought I should sink so low,&rdquo; answered Eben, mournfully, &ldquo;as to
      saw wood for a colored man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talkin' about?&rdquo; interrupted his boss, angrily. &ldquo;Ain't I as
      good as a worfless white man that begged a meal of vittles of me, coz he
      was starvin'? You jest shut up your mouf, and go to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben sadly resumed his labor. Herbert pitied him, in spite of his folly
      and wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben, do you owe this man anything?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he does. He owes me for his dinner. Don't you go to interfere!&rdquo;
       returned the colored man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much was your dinner worth?&rdquo; asked Herbert, putting his hand into his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was wuf a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is your money! Now, Eben, come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been very unfortunate,&rdquo; wailed Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go back to Wayneboro?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, anywhere,&rdquo; answered Eben, eagerly. &ldquo;I can't make a livin' here. I
      have almost starved sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben, I'll make a bargain with you. If I will take you home, will you
      turn over a new leaf, and try to lead a regular and industrious life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll do it,&rdquo; answered Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll take you with me to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't like my old friends to see me in these rags,&rdquo; said Eben,
      glancing with shame at his tattered clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall not. Come with me, and I will rig you out anew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a good fellow, Herbert,&rdquo; said Eben, gratefully. &ldquo;I'm sorry for the
      way I treated you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's all right,&rdquo; said Herbert. Herbert kept his promise. He took
      Eben to a barber shop, where there were also baths, having previously
      purchased him a complete outfit, and Eben emerged looking once more like
      the spruce dry-goods salesman of yore.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day not long afterwards Mrs. Carr was sitting in her little sitting
      room, sewing. She had plenty of leisure for this work now, for Mr. Graham
      had undertaken to attend to the post-office duties himself. It was natural
      that she should think of her absent boy, from whom she had not heard for a
      long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I see him again?&rdquo; she thought, wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to open it, but, before she could reach it, it flew open, and her
      boy, taller and handsomer than ever, was in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Herbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all she could say, but the tone was full of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I have missed you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will be together now, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, Herbert. Perhaps you can find something to do in Wayneboro,
      and even if it doesn't pay as well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; interrupted Herbert, laughing, &ldquo;is that the way to speak to a
      rich boy like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, I bring home twelve thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carr could not believe it at first, but Herbert told his story, and
      she gave joyful credence at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben did not receive as warm a welcome, but finally his father was
      propitiated, and agreed to give his son employment in his own store. He's
      there yet. His hard experience in the West has subdued his pride, and he
      has really &ldquo;turned over a new leaf,&rdquo; as he promised Herbert. His father
      will probably next year give him a quarter interest in the firm, and the
      firm's name will be
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EBENEZER GRAHAM &amp; SON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and his mother have moved to Boston. Our hero is learning business
      in the counting room of Mr. Compton. They live in a pleasant house at the
      South End, and Mr. Melville, restored to a very fair measure of health, is
      boarding, or, rather, has his home with them. He is devoting his time to
      literary pursuits, and I am told that he is the author of a brilliant
      paper in a recent number of the North American Review. Herbert finds some
      time for study, and, under the guidance of his friend and former employer,
      he has already become a very creditable scholar in French, German and
      English literature. He enjoys his present prosperity all the better for
      the hardships through which he passed before reaching it.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
